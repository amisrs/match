The guiding framework for this course will be an historical, cultural and political study of the major religious traditions and political ideologies that have informed and distinguished the key periods of Indian history up to today. A dramatic fact about India is that the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Sikh religions all had their genesis there and they all still inflect everyday 21st century Indian life.  Islam arrived as part of a foreign conquest, yet today India has the second largest Muslim population in the world.  India has also been a critical place of refuge for endangered religious communities including people of the Zoroastrian (Parsi) and Bahai traditions.  Although different from religions in many ways, political economic ideologies are also belief systems with revered symbols and rituals.  Indian nationalism and its distinctive style of secularism and 21st century globalism are the pivotal modern ideologies that we will explore.<br/><br/>BRIC India is based in New Delhi, the capital of India, and formerly the capital of both the Mughal Empire and British Raj. We will use three different learning methods to accomplish the goals of this course.  One will be scholarly reading and discussion, with guest speakers, films, and other classroom activities.  A second will be experiential and mini ethnographic work in the field.  This will include guided site visits to such places as the Taj Mahal, and participant observation of religious rituals at various places of worship.  The third method will be learning from social activists and taking small social actions ourselves.  We will do this in encounters with people working to emancipate child laborers and trafficked women, people working to preserve endangered traditional crafts while employing rural women, and people providing children of extreme poverty a superlative education.<br/><br/>By the end of the course you will have basic literacy in five world religions and a nuanced understanding of the diversity within each tradition in a 21st century urban Indian context.  You will also have new tools of cultural investigation that can be applied to any cultural scenario you encounter in the future.<br/><br/>Prerequisites: RHT and AHS<br/></td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=CVA2004&course_section=95&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_43\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">CVA2007-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=CVA2007&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">INTRO TO PHILOSOPHY</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">MW    11:30AM- 1:05PM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSlegers, Rosa\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Tomasso 107</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">29 of 30</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">CVA2407<br/>Introduction to Philosophy  <br/>(Intermediate Liberal Arts)<br/><br/>Introduction to Philosophy treats the most basic and pervasive human questions: Does God exist?

Radical political movements seek major transformations in the way we live together. Radical movements tend to work outside and even at odds with the mainstream political process that involves political parties and elections. Radical politics pushes from below by taking to the streets to blockade and confront those it opposes and to compel the public to pay attention. This form of politics also sets out radical critiques and solutions, such as abolishing policing and incarceration, decolonizing and returning territory to Indigenous peoples, dismantling capitalism in favor of more equitable form of economic relations that will also help us deal with climate change. These movements inspire artists to represent and speak to these causes, such as with the music of Rage Against the Machine, Kendrick Lamar, Beyonc\\xe9 and a Tribe Called Red, the poetry of Leanne Simpson, and films such as Rhymes for Young Ghouls and Fruitvale Station. Through an interdisciplinary approach, this course will look at the modern history and contemporary forms of radical politics, in theory, in action, and in culture. For the Spring 2017, the three major radical political movements we will examine will be, i) Black Lives Matter, ii) Indigenous people\\u2019s decolonizing activism, such as the Standing Rock Sioux\\u2019s effort to block the Dakota Access Pipeline, and iii) contemporary anarchist politics. We will examine these movements on their own and with regard to how their concerns, critiques and efforts intersect, possibly conflict, and generally raise questions and possibilities about how to radically critique and act against white supremacy, settler colonialism, capitalism, and climate change. The class will read and listen to the voices of theorists and commentators analyzing and critiquing these movements, the people directly involved in the movements, and the work of artists inspired by or engaging with these movements. As we do so we will ask such questions as: What makes radical politics radical and what sort of actions does that require of those who are involved? Does radical politics ever succeed, or does it always either fail, get coopted, or lead to comprise and small steps? To what degree does art and culture contribute to, capitalize upon or get inspired by and represent the aims of these radical movements? While these three movements will be the focus of this course, students will be encouraged to work on projects that examine other radical movements in our time. The course will focus on the North American context, but student projects and our discussions do not need to be limited to that context. The materials for this class will include historical and political scholarly analyses, journalism, documentaries, film, literature, music, public commentary, and the narratives of activists themselves.<br/><br/>prerequisites: RHT and AHS</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=CVA2033&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_49\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">CVA2034-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=CVA2034&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">NATURE AND US CULTURAL VALUES</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">MW     3:00PM- 4:35PM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHolmes, Steven\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Babson 305</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">21 of 30</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">CVA2034 Nature and U.S. Cultural Values<br/>4 credit (intermediate liberal arts)<br/><br/>In this course students will explore human concepts of nature pertaining to culture and values from the latter third of the nineteenth century to the present.

Through films and texts that explore questions of history and the representation of national and individual identities, we will consider cultural responses to the consequences of dictatorship and the new political, economic, and social realities that have emerged. Scholars, policymakers, and business leaders are among those interested in addressing the causes, character, and possibilities of these transformations. The democratic transition in Spain, which began with the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, provides a valuable point of comparison to our examination of various other country examples. What are the differing strategies used to come to terms with the past and the legacy of dictatorship? How successful have these political transitions been? What elements remain unresolved, and how do they continue to play out or find expression in the culture and society? <br/><br/>Prerequisites:  RHT and AHS<br/><br/>This course may be offered Fall or Spring semester.<br/></td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=CVA2058&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_53\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">ECN2000-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=ECN2000&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">PRINCIPLES OF MACROECONOMICS</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">MW     8:00AM- 9:35AM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStillwagon, Joshua\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Luksic 17</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">24 of 38</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">ECN2000<br/>Principles of Macroeconomics<br/>(Intermediate Liberal Arts Elective)<br/><br/>Analyzes the conceptualization, measurement, and determinants of key variables for any economy: output, employment, prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and their fluctuation with the national economy over the business cycle.

In answering these questions, the course introduces students to the economic and political environment in poor countries. Topics include measures of development, economic growth, macroeconomic poverty traps (such as conflict, being landlocked, and low quality of institutions), foreign aid, and microeconomic poverty traps (such as poor nutrition and health, low educational endowments, and incomplete markets). The course introduces empirical strategies in economics to identify causal effect, such as randomized controlled trials, instrumental variable, difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity. <br/><br/>Prerequisite: SME2031 and ECN2000</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=ECN3645&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_66\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">ECN3650-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=ECN3650&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC SYSTEMS</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">TR     9:45AM-11:20AM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBlitz, Amy\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Park Manor West 1/2</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">27 of 42</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">ECN3650<br/>Contemporary Economic Systems<br/>(Advanced Liberal Arts Elective)<br/><br/>At the heart of contemporary economic debates is the question: what role should government play in the economy? This course provides a framework for understanding the real world implications and outcomes of these debates in the context of economic theories, policies and systems. The course begins with an exploration of the major economic theories as they have emerged through time and the problems each theory has sought to address. The course explores the big ideas in economics from free markets to communism to managed markets, and covers the core debates surrounding the relevance of fiscal, monetary, trade and policy/regulatory policies. The course then uses several policy and country case studies to explore the application of these ideas to pressing issues such as structural unemployment, inequality, civil conflict, climate change and the impacts of trade, focusing as well on the potential role of businesses and entrepreneurs in addressing these issues. Emphasizing fact-based analysis in assessing the goals and outcomes of diverse policies, the course builds critical thinking skills and helps prepare students for leadership roles in a dynamic global business environment.<br/><br/>Prerequisite: SME2031 and ECN2000<br/></td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=ECN3650&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_67\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">ECN3655-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=ECN3655&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">TR    11:30AM- 1:05PM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSimon, Jessica\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Tomasso 308</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">24 of 42</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">ECN3655<br/>Managerial Economics<br/>(Advanced Lib Arts)<br/><br/>Whereas ECN3615 provides a more thorough understanding of the financial institutions, which are a very important sector of the macro economy, ECN3655 provides the analytical tools for managerial decision making and policy formulation for businesses and governments.

You will write short stories of varying lengths, aiming for authority over language, characterization and plot, and authenticity. Your fiction will be closely analyzed by your peers and professor.

Case material, lectures, frequent exercises/presentations and guest speakers will provide future entrepreneurs with a detailed understanding of how investors think, analyze and behave.  <br/><br/>This understanding is critical so that entrepreneurs can understand the deals they make with investors and how to manage the process to a mutually beneficial conclusion.<br/><br/>Prerequisites: None</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=EPS3540&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_90\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">EPS4510-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=EPS4510&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">MW     9:45AM-11:20AM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSantinelli, Angelo\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Luksic 101</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">42 of 42</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">EPS4510 Entrepreneurial Finance (formerly EPS3511)<br/> (General Credit)<br/><br/>This course focuses on the various aspects of funding and managing entrepreneurial ventures through the various stages of business growth and focuses on understanding business models and kinds of organizations and the various ways these can be financed (i.e corporate, technology, non-profit).

While the problems afflicting the poor are great, there is power in thinking small - how a simple, focused innovation can change an individual life, a personal choice or a system. <br/><br/>Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship (ADE) is an international, experiential social entrepreneurship and design course where students work in partnership with communities in India, Ghana, Morocco and Alabama to co-create and test innovation concepts and sustainable business models. The focus is on income generation and meeting daily human needs through new product and service design and development but the scope considers the cultural appropriateness of design choices and their impact on social venture success. This includes how design can impact the desirability and viability of innovations in different problem-opportunity contexts, examined in the innovation phases of observation, conception, strategic planning and implementation.<br/><br/>A joint offering by Babson and Olin College, the course integrates core elements of user-oriented collaborative design and engineering design with entrepreneurial opportunity shaping and venture strategy. Babson and Olin College students work collaboratively in cross-functional teams to exploit their respective expertise and strengths. Starting with ethnographic research, venture teams collaborate first-hand with local communities on focused issues to identify addressable problems and to evaluate and test potential innovation solutions. Mixing entrepreneurship and design pedagogies, the course takes a systems view considering how design choices in product/service design and business model design can enhance-or diminish-a social venture's impact.<br/><br/>The course is run as a virtual firm where students work on distributed teams to develop social ventures by engaging with partner organizations, prioritizing programs, and setting and pursing goals while deploying modest amounts of seed capital. The course is time-intensive but rich and immersive. Students travel once per semester to partner sites to build relationships, learn about local culture, understand and map needs, identify stakeholders, perform experiments and tests, and collect information on local infrastructure and value chains.<br/><br/>(a)  Prerequisites:    FME1000, EPS3501, Junior standing<br/><br/><br/><br/></td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=EPS4515&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_92\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">EPS4525-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=EPS4525&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">LIVING THE SOCIAL EPS EXPERIENCE</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">W      1:15PM- 4:25PM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGale, Mary\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Blank VCNF</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">13 of 25</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">EPS4525:  Living the Social Entrepreneurship Experience<br/>(General Credit)<br/><br/>EPS4525, EPS4530 (formerly EPS3530), EPS4531, EPS4532, EPS4533 and EPS4534 are equivalent courses.

With our lives continuing to get busier and more full, we will explore ways to be more mindful about who we want to be, explore what brings us joy and explore ways in which we can create space to be our authentic self.  We will use the time to think about our values and code of ethics and reflect on how they fit within the mission and vision of Babson College. Students will also be asked to reflect on their own abilities and how they can make an impact on campus and beyond.

In particular, this narrative is largely dominated by the two great wars and the Cold War. However, what made those conflicts so important was not just their impact on Europe and the Western World, but how those conflicts catalyzed mass movements globally.  This class examines the history of decolonization and revolution in the 20th Century, and how the world wars and the Cold War impacted processes of nationalism, independence, decolonization and revolution. Starting with the rise of Turkey and the Bolshevik revolution during the first world war, we will then analyze the independence movements that sprouted from the vestiges of the second world war, particularly those of China and India, as well as the emergence of Apartheid in South Africa. We will also explore the impact of the Cold War on revolution and decolonization, especially Vietnam and Algeria. Finally, the course will analyze how more recent revolutions, such as those in Iran and Israel /Palestine, are rooted in longer historical processes which highlight the continuing legacy of Imperialism and revolutionary resistance to imperialism in the contemporary world.  The course will use a variety of books, articles, movies, and music to analyze this deep, violent, and often conflicted aspect of human history.<br/><br/>Pre-requisites:  AHS and RHT <br/></td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=HSS2025&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_184\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">HSS2032-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=HSS2032&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">AFRICAN HISTORY AND FOODWAYS</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">MW     9:45AM-11:20AM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOpie, Frederick\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Trim 201</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">26 of 30</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">HSS2032 African American History and Foodways (HIS) <br/>4 credit intermediate liberal arts<br/><br/>The course covers the major periods, movements, and events that have shaped African American history and foodways.

We will consider the implications of global interdependence and the increasingly robust international judicial system for the principles and practice of public international law.  Does international law actually create global order, or does it merely reflect political order that exists in other settings?  When should national sovereignty and domestic prerogatives yield to international law and the desires of the global community?  What is the proper role of non-state actors (multinational businesses, NGOs, advocacy groups) in this global legal regime?<br/><br/>These questions (and many others) have been at the center of the quest to create global order in a rapidly changing world where the pace of technological innovation, personal and business entrepreneurship, and the increasingly free movement of people, capital, and ideas often far outpace the capacity of any legal regime (domestic or international) to keep up.  We will study these issues and related themes throughout the semester.  Special emphasis is placed on the application of public international law to international institutions, human rights (including the intersection of human rights with transnational business), the legal regulation of warfare (including \\u201chumanitarian\\u201d intervention and responses to global terrorism), the global environment and high seas, transnational dispute settlement, and business ethics in the global setting.  <br/> <br/>\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0<br/>Prerequisite: Foundation Law course, (LAW1000)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0<br/><br/>This course is typically offered in the following semester: Fall<br/></td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=LAW3601&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_212\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">LAW3662-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=LAW3662&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">AMER CONST LAW: FEDERAL SYSTEM</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">TR     1:15PM- 2:50PM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEhrlich, Craig P\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Gerber 213</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">24 of 30</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">LAW3662 AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW: The American Federal System of Government.  <br/>4 credit (Advanced Liberal Arts) <br/><br/>The purpose of this class is to acquaint you with the basic legal principles undergirding the American federal system of government.

We will trace the concept of witnessing in philosophical, legal, and human rights contexts before turning to novels and other literature of witness by international writers such as Pat Barker, Nadine Gordimer, Gunter Grass, Primo Levi, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Rigoberta Menchu, Toni Morrison, and Virginia Woolf in order to investigate the following questions: What kinds of events generate or require witnesses, and how does witnessing differ from simply seeing? What effects does the event have upon the witness, and vice versa? What does it mean for literature to act as a kind of witness?

Many organizations are now interested in capturing, distributing and applying the knowledge of their employees for business benefit. Also, companies need to keep track of knowledge outside of their corporate walls, for example, understanding market trends and being aware of what customers are saying about their products. Ultimately, the goal of Enterprise 2.0 is to break down traditional information silos and allow employees and managers to tap into the right people and expertise when they need it. <br/><br/>In this course we will discuss the current state of the Enterprise 2.0 movement. We will also explore how social collaboration tools (often referred to as social media and Web 2.0) are being used by organizations to leverage the \"wisdom of the crowds.\" Organizations are increasingly using tools such as blogs, wikis, social tagging, and social networking tools to achieve emergent collaboration and to break down information silos. Knowledge workers are also using social technologies to build their personal brand and personal network. <br/><br/>Student projects will emphasize a \\u201chands-on\\u201d approach to understanding the latest social technologies. We will use organizational network analysis (ONA) software, a methodology to analyze the structure of social networks, or the people-to-people connections in organizations. ONA is an increasingly popular application used by both management consultants and internal organizational practices (e.g., knowledge management, IS, HR, R&amp;D;) to understand information flows and \\u201cinfluencers\\u201d inside and outside a company. We will also use software tools such as NodeXL &amp; text analysis tools to \\u201clisten\\u201d to what is being said on social platforms. Another project will have students create a social media campaign for an organization, including providing metrics on how to evaluate the success of the campaign. We will also experiment with mobile applications, such as location-based services (e.g., Foursquare, SCVNGR) on smartphones.<br/><br/>Prerequisite: FME1000 and FME1001<br/></td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=MIS3525&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_246\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">MIS3545-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=MIS3545&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND DATA ANALYTICS</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">TR     9:45AM-11:20AM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLi, Zhi\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Horn Computer Center 159</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">42 of 42</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">MIS Business Intelligence and Data Analytics<br/>4 credit \\u2013 general credit\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0<br/><br/>This course is about how organizations and their employees can successfully collect, evaluate and apply information to become better decision makers.

These applications and models have evolved into the next generation that is making it easier for enterprises, especially small and medium sized, to compete by building applications on top of the existing infrastructure and applications (Facebook, Google, Amazon, YouTube, etc.) that are now available to them for reuse.  In order for managers to design their enterprises for competitive advantage, they need to understand and leverage the new infrastructure.  Managers need to understand concepts like architecture, shared services, global work, opensource development, business platforms, network effects and services to create even more powerful business models.  As a result of applying these concepts, managers can bring to market new products and services at a faster pace.   The core concepts and technologies discussed in this class are important to both consumers and providers of services.  We will examine business designs by discussing the underlying technology and how it helps shape strategy using case studies, conceptual papers and interactions with industry experts.

Case studies and class discussions will explore operations topics which are unique to start-ups including:   Operational Business Models; Start-up Operation Metrics; How to Find a Supplier/Operations Partner; Product/Service Outsourcing Mistakes; Challenges in Achieving Product/Service Quality Control; How to select a Product/Service Distribution Channel; Managing Start-up Inventory; Challenges in meeting Product/Service Demand; Handling Market Uncertainty and Supply Uncertainty; Importance of Operational Flexibility; Bootstrapping Operational Costs; Operational Scalability.<br/><br/>Local entrepreneurs will serve as frequent guest speakers who can provide real-world insights on their own operational challenges, failures and success as they developed their ventures. <br/><br/>This course is an approved elective for the Operations management concentration.<br/><br/>Prerequisites: Second Year Management Experience (SME) or permission of the instructor.<br/><br/><br/></td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=MOB3503&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_265\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">MOB3511-A01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=MOB3511&amp;course_section=A01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">BUSINESS PRESENTATIONS</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">T      7:00PM-10:15PM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSinnott, Sharon L\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Horn Computer Center 159</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">16 of 15</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">2.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">MOB3511 Business Presentations<br/>2 credit general credit<br/><br/>This is a performance course designed to build upon basic presentation skills and concepts.

Sustainability thinking challenges entrepreneurial leaders to enable the transition to a sustainable economic system, by identifying business opportunities and leading transformation of business culture. Students will learn about the systemic view of sustainability on how organizations can create social value while simultaneously delivering realistic economic returns: repurpose, stakeholder involvement, design &amp; implementation of innovations and metrics development. Students will develop practical knowledge and skillset from design thinking and systems thinking as integral disciplines to manage human, financial, and other resources in innovations that transform businesses. Our goal is to provide the basis for a common language and understanding of the intersection between environmental/social issues and sustainability, innovation and entrepreneurship, business strategy, and organizational culture. Ultimately, students will develop their understanding of how to lead the transformation of a conventional business into a sustainable business. <br/><br/>The course is composed of four parts. The first part will give students an overview of the sustainability thinking and allied strategy and the tools for designing the process through which it happens: what dimensions and questions might be considered to evaluate and guide sustainability. Having identified both the challenges and tools associated with sustainability, the second part will make the case for making a product or service sustainable. The third part will shift the discussion to making an organization sustainable and characteristics of sustainability leaders. Finally, the fourth part will reflect on making your life sustainable. Students will explore how to apply ideas from the course to a more sustainable way of living. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Pre-requisite:  SME2002 or SUS1201<br/></td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=MOB3522&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_271\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">MOB3546-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=MOB3546&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">CONTEMPORARY STRATEGIC ISSUES IN CHILE</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\"><br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSims, Jonathan<br/> Elective, Abroad\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\"> </td>\\n<td width=\"70\">15 of 0</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">MOB3546: Contemporary Strategic Issues in Chile<br/>Program Fee: $2,140<br/>International Flight: $1,160<br/>Program fee and group international airfare is paid to Glavin Office, program fee includes accommodations, breakfast, airport transfers US &amp; Chile, group ground transportation, program-planned meals and cultural excursions.

Marine systems are a nexus of life \\u2013 crucial sources of protein for human populations, reservoirs of minerals, and regulators of the global climate. However, human populations have increased demand for ocean resources in greater numbers than is ecologically sustainable. In addition, the ocean serves as a dumping ground for many types of waste, resulting in waters degraded by pollution.  The objective of this course is to give you a basic understanding of the physical, biological, and chemical processes driving ocean fundamentals. In addition, we will examine how human demand on marine resources impacts ocean communities.  <br/><br/>This course will stress the importance of the scientific method \\u2013 both in principle and in practice.  Extensive discussion of human environmental impacts on the ocean (e.g., climate change, marine pollution, overfishing) will enhance perspectives of self-awareness and ethical decision-making related to social, economic and environmental responsibility and sustainability (SEERS). Critical analysis is emphasized in class discussions, exam questions, lab reports, written assignments, and the group project.

Marine systems are a nexus of life \\u2013 crucial sources of protein for human populations, reservoirs of minerals, and regulators of the global climate. However, human populations have increased demand for ocean resources in greater numbers than is ecologically sustainable. In addition, the ocean serves as a dumping ground for many types of waste, resulting in waters degraded by pollution.  The objective of this course is to give you a basic understanding of the physical, biological, and chemical processes driving ocean fundamentals. In addition, we will examine how human demand on marine resources impacts ocean communities.  <br/><br/>This course will stress the importance of the scientific method \\u2013 both in principle and in practice.  Extensive discussion of human environmental impacts on the ocean (e.g., climate change, marine pollution, overfishing) will enhance perspectives of self-awareness and ethical decision-making related to social, economic and environmental responsibility and sustainability (SEERS). Critical analysis is emphasized in class discussions, exam questions, lab reports, written assignments, and the group project. Assignments facilitate development of logical communication skills, appropriate use of graphs and tables, and organizing, synthesizing, evaluating and interpreting scientific information.  Through lab and group activities, this course fosters team work and ability to work with others.

Where does the idea come from and how has the concept in practice changed over time? How does race shape historical and contemporary social and political life in the United States, and beyond? How do we, and how can we, talk about race today? These are just a few of the general questions we attend to in this Advanced Liberal Arts Course on Critical Race Studies. Critical race studies is a multi-disciplinary field that analyzes historical and contemporary racial formations, hierarchies, and politics. The presumption of a critical race studies approach is that racial inequality and injustice are not consigned to a long distant American past, but still shape present day political, social, economic, and cultural life in fundamental ways. In other words, we do not live in a post-racial society. The readings for the course generally stem from scholarly work in the fields of political theory and American politics, as well as from well-known authors and activists such as James Baldwin and Angela Davis. The course will also attend to the intersections among race, class, gender, sexuality, and colonialism, including reading works by Marxist, feminist, queer theory, and Indigenous studies scholars. The class will be run in a participatory, seminar format in which students will develop individual class projects from a wide-range of potential topics. In the past, students in this course have completed projects that focus on the relevance of race to such topics as political movements and campaigns, legal decisions, film, sports, gender, fashion, sexuality, business, and science.<br/><br/>Prerequisites: Any combination of 3 intermediate liveral arts (CVA, LVA, HSS)</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=POL4630&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_300\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">QTM1000-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=QTM1000&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">QM FOR BUSINESS ANALYTICS I</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">MW     9:45AM-11:20AM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRybolt, William H\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Gerber 101</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">31 of 31</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">4.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">QTM1000: Quantitative Methods for Business Analytics I<br/>4 credits <br/> <br/>The course introduces the necessary core quantitative methods that are prerequisites to follow-on courses in QTM and in Babson's integrated core business offerings.

This course investigates the relationship between ecological systems and high density areas of the human population. We will begin by discovering the nature within cities. Frequently when discussing nature, far-off lands of pristine wilderness are envisioned, but these people-less areas are inaccessible and often not relatable for much of the population. Many of the vital ecosystem services for which human life depends are derived from under-appreciated urban habitats. We will also investigate global human demography trends and socio-economic patterns within cities. The course then focuses on envisioning cities as integrated social-ecological systems. Cities and the people who live in them consume land, water, and energy resources that often originate outside the city\\u2019s boundaries. Air, water, and solid waste pollution are also produced and distributed widely. We will discuss the limitations and problems within much of the current built environment, but also explore new sustainable and inclusive urban planning strategies that include innovative architectural design and green technologies.  This course will cover topics ranging from applied ecology and conservation biology to human demography, social justice and sustainable development. This course will emphasize the development of skills in critical thinking, synthesis of information, science literacy, hand-on exercises, and current topical issues in urban ecology.  <br/><br/>Prerequisite: NST10%%<br/></td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=SCN3650&course_section=A01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_364\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">SCN3655-B01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=SCN3655&amp;course_section=B01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">BIOMIMICRY DESIGN INNOVATION FROM NATURE</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">TR     1:15PM- 2:50PM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRodgers, Vikki\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Tomasso 107</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">20 of 25</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">2.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">SCN3655: BIOMIMICRY: DESIGN INNOVATION FROM NATURE <br/>2 CREDITS<br/><br/>**This half semester course can be paired with SCN3650: Urban Ecology (first half of the semester) for students looking for 4 credits of advanced liberal arts science, or it can be taken alone for 2 credits.**<br/><br/>In this course we will investigate the tools and principles of biomimicry, which seek to sustainably solve current challenges by taking inspiration from how nature solves these same problems. Nature provides us with an incredible amount of research and development for effective problem-solving methodologies with the ultimate test for organisms being survival of the fittest. For the past 3.8 billion years, life has evolved strategies that are constantly integrated and optimized to create conditions conducive for life to continue. When biomimicry is well done, it is not just imitation, but rather inspiration using the design principles that nature has shown to be successful. Interest in biomimicry has expanded quickly and according to a recent Forbes article, \\u201cbiomimicry patents, scholarly articles and research grants have increased by more than five times since 2000. By 2030, the field could account for $425 billion of US GDP and $1.6 trillion of total global output, [the Fermanian Business &amp; Economic Institute] estimates.\\u201d In this course we will begin by investigating life\\u2019s principles and applying them to specific product design strategies by asking questions like \\u201cHow does nature make color?\\u201d and \\u201cHow does nature water-proof something?\\u201d The second half of the course will then emphasize ecosystem design to understand how we can use inspiration from ecological function and interconnectedness as a way to solve problems in businesses and organizations. We will focus on understanding the biology, chemistry, physics and ecology of nature\\u2019s designs in order to apply them to both product and process design.

To be effective, entrepreneurs and managers must design operations, model the expected performance of operational designs, make decisions that strategically manage costs, and take actions that achieve desired results in an ethical manner. The two streams in this module will help build the skills you need to become ethical entrepreneurial leaders and managers.

Effective financial management, whether performed by the general manager in a small business, or by the finance organization in a large corporation, is necessary if a venture is to succeed and grow. A successful financial manager must have skills, abilities, tools, and a theoretical understanding in many areas, including valuation, financial forecasting, capital budgeting, investor expectations regarding risk and return, the cost of investor supplied capital, and financial strategy.

Styles such as Symbolism, Cubism, Futurism, Expressivism, Dada and Surrealism were their responses to changes in established ways of thinking and being that marked the beginning of the 20th century. Visits to The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, The Davies Museum of Wellesley College and the Fogg Museum of Harvard University, which have very strong collections from this period, will offer students the opportunity to directly experience this art.<br/><br/>Prerequisites: Any combination of 3 intermediate liberal arts (HSS LVA CVA)</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=VSA4615&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}, {'text': <tr><td>\\n<div id=\"detail_container_419\" style=\"position: relative; display: \">\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">WRT1000-01</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=WRT1000&amp;course_section=01&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">INTENSIVE RHETORIC WRITING TUTORIAL</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">W      4:00PM- 9:00PM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFischer, Katrin\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Malloy 204</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">17 of 0</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">0.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">WRT1000<br/>Intensive Rhetoric Writing Tutorial <br/>(Foundation Lib Arts)<br/><br/>Prerequisites: NONE</td></tr>\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td width=\"10\">\\xa0</td>\\n<td width=\"85\">WRT1000-02</td>\\n<td width=\"250\"><a href=\"javascript: openWindow('index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&amp;semester=Fall 2017&amp;course_number=WRT1000&amp;course_section=02&amp;program=Undergraduate&amp;sort_by=course_description', 'winCourseDetail', 600, 400);\">INTENSIVE RHETORIC WRITING TUTORIAL</a></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">R      4:00PM- 9:00PM<br/></td>\\n<td width=\"140\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLeonard, Melissa\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">Malloy 204</td>\\n<td width=\"70\">19 of 0</td>\\n<td width=\"45\">0.00</td>\\n<td width=\"50\">Full Session</td>\\n<td>\\xa0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\">\\xa0</td><td colspan=\"7\">WRT1000<br/>Intensive Rhetoric Writing Tutorial <br/>(Foundation Lib Arts)<br/><br/>Prerequisites: NONE</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>, 'link': u'https://fusionmx.babson.edu/CourseListing/index.cfm?fuseaction=CourseListing.DisplayCourseDetail&semester=Fall 2017&course_number=WRT1000&course_section=01&program=Undergraduate&sort_by=course_description'}]"
