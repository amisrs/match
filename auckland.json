It provides a detailed analysis of the\nstructure, function and application of the general anti-avoidance provision and its relationship\nto the \u201cblack-letter\u201d tax law. Comparisons with the statutory and common law responses to\ntax avoidance in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, the UK and US, provide a\ndeeper understanding of the policy behind New Zealand\u2019s general anti-avoidance provision.\nGoals of the Course\nThe paper is an advanced course studying New Zealand\u2019s GAAR. The objectives of the\ncourse are to provide students with both a theoretical background and high level of technical\nknowledge of the scope and application of the most significant aspects of the law and practice\nof this extremely controversial provision under the Income Tax Act 2007. Where appropriate,\na comparison is made with the regimes of our major trading partners, in order to provide a\ndeeper understanding of the policy behind New Zealand\u2019s regime.\nThe course provides students with an opportunity to increase their research, writing and group\npresentation skills. The final exam (which is by way of answering a case study) requires\nstudents to apply all aspects of avoidance jurisprudence which they have mastered during the\ncourse. Emphasis is therefore placed on good analytical skills and presentation of researched,\ncomprehensive and well reasoned solutions. In addition the course gives the student the\nopportunity to participate in a group discussion and legal moot which is conducted in a\nsupportive and entertaining environment.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents who take and pass this course will be able to:\n1. Identify and comprehend the major aspects of the operation of the GAAR in the\nIncome Tax Act 2007\n2. Analyse the policies and principles underlying this regime\n3. Analyse the application of the GAAR regime to business transactions for the purposes\nof providing advice and administering the tax system\n4. Demonstrate by synthesis enhanced research, writing and presentation skills\n\n\fLearning and Teaching\nTax avoidance is a mix of lecturing and research and a seminar-based course.\nThe course will be taught on an intensive basis over 3 days each on:\n\uf0b7 Thurs \u2013 Sat, 11 to 13 September 2014\nTimes for the sessions each day will be detailed with a course contents schedule but broadly is\n9am to 5pm. It is likely that the finishing time for Saturday is earlier than 5pm.\nTeaching Staff:\nJames Coleman\nBarrister\nTerrace Chambers\nGround Floor No 1 The Terrace\nPO Box 10 201\nWellington\nPhone 04 473 4511\nFax 04 499 6172\nMobile 027 671 3025\nemail james.coleman@terracechambers.co.nz\n\nwww.jhcoleman.co.nz\n\nCraig Elliffe\nDepartment of Commercial Law\nThe University of Auckland Business School\n12 Grafton Road\nAuckland City\nPhone 09 923 8990\nemail: c.elliffe@auckland.ac.nz\nThere will also be a number of guest lecturers presenting throughout the course.\nLearning Resources\nThere is no prescribed text but it is essential that students have a copy of the Income Tax Act\n2007. A recommended text is the book Tax Avoidance Law in New Zealand by James\nColeman (CCH in the latest edition). In preparation of their papers, students will be expected\nto be able to make use of the appropriate library and internet resources, including but not\nlimited to:\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand, United Kingdom, Australian and other case law;\n\n\uf0b7\n\nAcademic journals (held in the Auckland University collections or on Lexis/\nNexis);\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand Government materials, including:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\nAll published New Zealand IRD material\nNew Zealand Government Discussion Documents\nNew Zealand Consultative Committee Documents\nStatutory material both current and historical.\n\nTax treaties.\n\n\fThere are a variety of on-line resources available that will assist students in this course. Davis\nLaw Library staff are available to assist students in accessing all on-line materials available.\nA course book will be distributed to students prior to the course. Please endeavour to have\nread as much as you can.\nAssessment\nThe final grade for the course is made up by the following:\n\nAttendance and Participation in seminars\nFinal Take-home Exam\n\n20%\n80%\n\nDue to the technical nature of the Income Tax Act 2007, the course assessments test research\nand analytical skills. Each piece of written work requires students to demonstrate knowledge\nof a number of different regimes of the Act, thereby testing their depth of knowledge and\nunderstanding of the underlying policy.\nPlusage does not apply.\nRefer to the Postgraduate Guide 2014 for further information.\n\nFinal take-home exam :\nYour course lecturer will indicate the maximum word limit for the answer to that case study,\nwhich is to be strictly observed.\nPapers are expected to be well researched and considered works, which set out clearly their\nintended scope and deal with the subject in a well-structured fashion. Perspectives on a topic\nmay be gained from a historical or comparative analysis, or from insights provided by other\ndisciplines, eg accounting or economics. Their presentation should be of a high standard,\nsimilar to that required for submission to an academic journal. Case, text and journal citations\nshould be in the format prescribed by the New Zealand Law Style Guide. Grades will be\nawarded in accordance with the Department\u2019s policy \u201cThe Basis for Assessment of Legal\nWriting\u201d.\nAttendance and Participation\nAttendance and participation are worth 20% of the final grade. Allocating marks to class\nparticipation reflects the desire to encourage feedback and discussion within the course. As\nall seminar papers are circulated one week before presentation, all students need to have read\nand considered these papers prior to the class, and be prepared to discuss them. The small\nsize of the classes encourages interaction and student participation.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: Selected Applicants with BCom, BCom(hons), LLB, LLB(hons) or similar.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSADMIN762.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nBUSADMIN 762: Marketing (15 points)\n\nQuarter 2 (1174)\n___________________________________________________________\nCourse Prescription\nThis course examines customer value and value-creation in markets, and the implications\nfor marketing, marketing decision-making and marketing strategy development.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nRestriction: BUSADMIN 772.\n\nGoals of the Course\nThis course will explore the processes that drive value creation for both customers and\nenterprises.

These activities include preparing for lectures,\nreading the course materials, solving recommended practice problems, working on the\nassessment for this course, etc.\nStudents are expected to have read and digested the assigned textbook chapters and\nother readings before class, and be ready to discuss them.\n\n2\n\n\fTeaching Staff\nDr. Rick Starr\nSenior Lecturer in Marketing, Graduate School of Management\nOffice: 376 Owen Glenn Building, University of Auckland City Campus, OGGB 376\nTel:\n09 923 2403\nMobile: 021 637 915\nEmail: rg.starr@auckland.ac.nz\nDialogue is important for learning. Feel free to email me with questions or comments.\nHowever, I generally find that most of your questions are too complex to answer fully via\nemail. Unless the answer is really simple (such as yes or no), I will usually call you back\nto discuss them.

Further clarification will be provided in class.\n\nInclusive Learning\nThe University of Auckland is committed to providing an equitable and inclusive learning\nenvironment. Students are encouraged to discuss any special requirements or learningrelated issues in confidence, either in person or via email.\n\nDecorum\nCivility is in short supply in the modern world, but it will be expected in this course. We\ncan and will have rollicking discussions, and robust disagreement over ideas is vital and\nuseful. However, there is a clear line that will not be crossed in this classroom: ad hominem\nattacks, or invective with racist, sexist, homophobic, or anti (insert group here) will not\nbe tolerated.\n\nStudent Feedback\nStudents\u2019 opinions about this course will be taken as valuable feedback, which the\nGraduate School of Management will use to improve future iterations of the course.\nStudents will be asked to complete evaluation forms for this course in the latter part of\nthis course.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\n4\n\n\fDetailed Information on Written Assignments\nIndividual Assignment: Co-Creating Value\nThe focus of this course is using marketing approaches to create value for a range of\nstakeholders, including the marketer\u2019s organisation, channel intermediaries, end\ncustomers, and other affected parties. A key part of this focus is the idea of co-creating\nvalue: we cannot create value for another, but we can work with them to build value\nperceptions together. This individual assignment asks you to consider a marketplace\noffering, existing or new, and approaches you could use to foster value co-creation.\nTasks:\n1. Select a brand, product, service, idea or person(s). You may use an existing\nentity, or choose to focus on a new venture. Explain the key features of your\nchosen offering.\n2. Discuss the target audiences.\n3. What are the target audience wants and needs? Note: in many cases, the target\nmay not fully understand their wants and needs, or may be unable to articulate\ntheir desires. You will need to tease these issues apart to form a supportable\npoint of view.\n4. How will you position your offering?\n5. Explain the approaches and strategies you will use to co-create value.\n6. Give an honest assessment of the strengths, weaknesses and likely outcomes of\nyour approach.\n\nLength:\n\n3000 words, \u00b110%\n\nFormat: paper submission, with a .pdf version also submitted via Canvas\nDue date: Week 5, 26 April, at beginning of class\nAssessment weighting: 30% of final grade\n\n5\n\n\fGroup Assignment: Applying Marketing Approaches\nThe marketing discipline offers a useful lens for examining issues. It can provide a way to\nframe problems, a base of theories for understanding the internal workings of the problem,\nand a set of tools that can be applied to make appropriate improvements. This group\nassignment asks you to consider these facets of marketing in an integrated way.\nTasks\n1. Develop a group, preferably of 3 to 4 people, to work on the assignment.\nI will expect more work and a higher level of polish from larger groups.\n2. Select a major business, governmental or societal issue or problem.\n3. Explain the key features of the issue or problem.\n4. State the major (and perhaps minor) aspects of the problem that have\nmarketing implications.\n5. Suggest the areas or aspects of the issue that marketing tools and insights can fix\nor improve.\n6. Assuming you have scarce resources (money, people, and perhaps time), develop\na ranked priority list of the marketing actions you would take.\n7. Provide an assessment of the level of change and success you might expect from\ntaking these actions.\nLength:\n\n2500-3000 carefully chosen words\n\nFormat:\n\npaper submission, with a .pdf version also submitted via Canvas\n\nDue Date: Week 8, 17 May, at beginning of class\nAssessment weighting: 25% of final grade\nPlease note: many of the most important problems facing the world are complex and may\nseem intractable. A large and difficult issue that can yield only minor improvements may\nbe much more important than a simple problem in which marketing can achieve great\nsuccess. Consider choosing a problem that is interesting and important, even if it is not\neasy.\n\n6\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/ACCTG371.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nACCTG 371: FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS\n(15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCourse Prescription\nHow is financial statement information used to evaluate a firm's performance,\nrisk and value?

This is why we have written this\nprotocol which describes the key policies and practices that will help you to have a clear understanding of what you can expect\nfrom your lecturer and what the lecturer can expect from you. In respect to this, our overriding principles are consistency and\nfairness in terms of how each student is treated.\nCommunication\nCourse-Coordinators, Lecturers and Tutors will always aim to communicate with you in a timely and efficient manner. The\nmain venue where the course information will be provided are lectures and tutorials. Additionally, the main information related\nto the course, such as deadlines for your assignments, can be found in the Course Outline. Some Course Outlines may be\nprovided electronically while others are available in hardcopy.\nWe also use Canvas software to help students keep track of their own progress, e.g. allowing students to check their own\nmarks on the web. Some marketing lecturers may also use Canvas software to:\n\u25baProvide students with unrestricted access to course materials (lecture notes, case studies and reference materials).\nStudents will be able to access these materials anytime and anywhere via the Internet.\n\u25baKeep students informed with changes to the schedule, upcoming events, and opportunities for part time marketing jobs or\nsocial events.\nPlease note that the information posted on Canvas does not fully cover information given in lectures. Therefore, if you miss\na class, you should ask other students whether you have missed any important announcements (or materials). It is your\nresponsibility to monitor, read, and keep up to date on all course communications.\nThe email address you have listed in Canvas must be one that you use and check most frequently. This is the address to\nwhich your course lecturers will send any important messages and updates. Your current mailing address and other contact\ndetails must always be kept up to date on Student Services Online, the University\u2019s online enrolment and student\nadministration system. You can update your personal details by logging on to Student Services Online and then clicking on\n\u201cUpdate your details\u201d.\nGrading\nThis is the distribution that students are graded on for undergraduate courses in the Department of Marketing:\nGRADE\nA+\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\nC\nCD+\nD\nD-\n\nDESCRIPTION\nOutstanding\nExcellent\nApproaching Excellence\nVery good, comfortably meeting expectations\nGood, meets expectations\nGood, just meets expectations but minor problems\nAdequate, almost meeting expectations but minor problems\nAdequate, not quite meeting expectations because of problems\nJust adequate, not quite meeting expectations because of further problems\nInadequate, further problems and below expectations\nInadequate, well below expectations because of major problems\nCompletely inadequate, well below expectations because of major problems\n\n%\n90-100\n85-89\n80-84\n75-79\n70-74\n65-69\n60-64\n55-59\n50-54\n45-49\n40-44\n0-39\n\nPlease note: The grade scales are indicative only. Scaling may be applied.\n\n8\n\n\fAssignments\nPlease note that group and individual assignment weightings can NOT be transferred to the final exam/assessment.\nWhen handing in your assignments, please use the appropriate cover sheet, and please use your official name, as is currently\nused in University records. You will have considerable advance notice about the date that assignments are due. Therefore,\nyou must plan your work to give yourself leeway so unforeseen events such as computer problems or losing an assignment\ndo not prevent you from handing the assignment in on time. Unacceptable reasons for a late assignment also include being\noverseas or other work or sporting commitments. Acceptable reasons for handing a late assignment might be a longer period\nof illness prior to the deadline, unexpected incarceration or bereavement. However, in these circumstances you will be required\nto provide suitable documentation as evidence (e.g. a certificate from the campus Health Centre), as early as possible, but no\nlater than the assignment due date.\nStudents will be penalised for handing in assignments after the due date. Below is a list of penalties that can be expected:\n1 day late 10% off grade achieved by student\n2 days late 20% off grade achieved by student\n3 days late 30% off grade achieved by student\n4 days late 40% off grade achieved by student\n5 days late 50% off grade achieved by student\nNote: Assignments handed in five minutes past the deadline are considered one day late. If an assignment is due in on a\nFriday, then an assignment submitted on Monday is considered to be three days late. Assignments handed in later than five\ndays after the deadline will not be graded. Although these penalties may seem harsh, their purpose is to prepare you for the\nexpectations your employer will have of you (i.e. planning your time efficiently, and meeting deadlines) while maintaining fair\nand equitable treatment of all students.\nFor group assignments, all members of the group will be awarded the same group assignment mark, unless the course\ncoordinator is informed of group issues that may have adversely affected the group work. Such issues must be brought to the\nattention of the course co-ordinator before the assignment due date.\nIn group assignments where peer assessment is used, students not contributing equally to the group effort may be penalised.\nTherefore students should inform their team mates, and the teaching staff, if they are unable to contribute equitably to the\ngroup assignment at any point. Once again, suitable documentation must be given to the course co-ordinator as early as\npossible, but no later than the assignment due date.\nGrading of Assessments\nStudents can expect all mid-semester tests and assignments to be graded and returned in tutorials within two weeks (unless\notherwise specified by lecturer). Your grades will be viewable on Canvas as soon as they are available. Always remember to\ncompare your grades on Canvas with the grades that are written on your test or assignments, and report any discrepancies\nto your lecturer or tutor without delay.\nImportance of Mid-Semester Tests and the Final Exam\nMid-semester tests provide an opportunity for students to test their individual knowledge under controlled conditions, and also\nallow students to practice for the final exam. The final exam is an integral part of each paper and accounts for a large\npercentage of your final grade. Failing the final exam may make it very difficult to pass a paper.\nIt is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of the location, time, and date of their mid-semester tests and final exams. Students\nwho miss mid-semester tests or final exams because of ill health or bereavement reasons may apply for an aegrotat or for\ncompassionate consideration (see the University Calendar/Examination Regulations for the relevant procedures). Be aware\nthat you have to apply within 7 days after the test/exam.\nNote: Acceptable reasons for missing tests/exams include documented illness of yourself or your dependent(s), incarceration\nand bereavement. Reasons such as going on vacation, sporting or work commitments, or getting the date and/or time of test\nwrong etc. are not acceptable. If you are disabled or have other difficulties necessitating special accommodation for the\ntest/exam (e.g. a longer test time, or a separate testing room), please advise the Course Coordinator as soon as possible.\nClass Representatives\nThe Marketing Department values the role of class representatives and encourages students to act in this capacity. Students\nare encouraged to talk to class representatives about the course. Lecturers really appreciate the class representatives\u2019\nfeedback. This channel is used as an opportunity to make improvements to the course. There are two formal class\n\n9\n\n\frepresentative meetings during a semester. During these meetings, class representatives have the opportunity to talk to the\nlecturers and the undergraduate co-ordinator about the overall evaluation of the course, and provide ideas and suggestions.\nDisputes\nIf you have a problem with any Marketing course, first approach your lecturer or course co-ordinator. If you are uncomfortable\napproaching your course co-ordinator then please contact the Marketing Department\u2019s undergraduate co-ordinators:\n\u2022 Dr Catherine Frethey-Bentham (OGGB, level 4, phone: 373 7599 Ext. 88830, e-mail: c.bentham@auckland.ac.nz)\nor\n\u2022 Dr Charlotta Windahl (OGGB, level 4, phone: 373 7599 Ext. 86301, e-mail: c.windahl@auckland.ac.nz).\nStudents who wish to query their final exam and/or final grade must do so through the appropriate channels (for the procedure\nsee the University Calendar/Examination Regulations). You can apply only for a recount (not a remark) of your exam. Please\ndo not contact your lecturers directly because they will not be able to give out any information on final exam marks.\nAttachment:\nCOPYRIGHT WARNING NOTICE\nThis material is protected by copyright and has been copied by and solely for the educational purposes of the University under\nlicence.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking, plagiarism can occur if you use the work\nand ideas of others without explicit acknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be reviewed against electronic source\nmaterial using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an\nelectronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt about how to reference properly, ask\nsomeone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student Learning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following\nwebsite for further information about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid plagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for the assignment. Major offences can\nbe sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee, where further penalties can be imposed.\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to seek assistance from third parties\nyou are advised that there are important limits on the amount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing\nyour assignments, including group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends, parents, SLC tutors,\nand paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that can be given. If you are seeking the\nassistance of any third party you are required to give a copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting\nyou.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work, not an electronic version. You must\nkeep a copy of this printed version and produce it if required.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s Referen\u00a9ite website\nwww.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online resource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite\nexplains the essentials of referencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students reference\ncorrectly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some major reference formats with examples.\n\n10\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/INTBUS705.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2016\nIB705: Advanced ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n(15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1143)\n\nCourse Prescription\nAdvanced study of entrepreneurship in an international context.

Assignments\nAll assignments must be completed. The date and cut-off time for handing in will be\nshown on the assignment. Assignments should be handed in to the Assignment\nCollection and Distribution Centre on Level 0 of the Owen G. Glenn Building and\nenclosed in the Department of Accounting and Finance cover sheet which is obtainable\nfrom the Centre. Assignments will be marked, recorded, and handed back via the\nAssignment Distribution Centre. Assignment marks recorded against your name may\nbe viewed through Cecil.

If you are unable to complete an\nassignment on time due to illness or for compassionate reasons please obtain a medical\ncertificate and discuss an appropriate extension with your lecturer.\n7.2. Quizzes\nDetails will be announced later.\n7.3. Mid-term test\nThe mid-term test is a one-hour closed-book all-multiple-choice test. Venues and\ncoverage will be announced later.\nAn implicit agreement within the university is that the smaller class makes necessary\narrangements for a timetable clash. Please report a timetable clash in advance if you are\nsure that the other class is bigger (e.g., first stage or second stage course with a bigger\nclass size). An early or late test will be given for those affected by a timetable clash.\nAfter receiving all timetable clashes, the department manager will book a room and\ncontact the students a few days before the test.\nAny queries regarding the test questions should be made within one-week after the\nanswers are posted on Cecil. No correction will be made after the graded tests are\nhanded back via the Assignment Distribution Centre except for simple addition errors.\nAddition errors do happen. Please keep your test.\n3\n\n\fAegrotat issues, if possible, should be reported to the university examinations office\n(+64 9 923 5776 or email exams@auckland.ac.nz).

Plagiarism, Copying or Cheating:\nStudents are reminded that the University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or\nassisting others to cheat, and views cheating in coursework as a serious academic matter.\nThe work that a student submits for grading must be the student's own work, reflecting\nhis or her learning. Where work from other sources is used, it must be properly\nacknowledged and referenced. This requirement also applies to sources on the worldwide web. A student's assessed work may be reviewed against electronic source material\nusing computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be\nrequired to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review. If a\nstudent gives some or all of their work to another student who then represents it as theirs,\nthen the student who gave the work is assisting or colluding in cheating. Both parties in\nthis case may be subject to penalties.\nPlagiarism occurs when students use ideas, word sequences, diagrams and other forms\nof work established prior to the particular student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s submission, without acknowledging\nthe source of the work used. This will include work done by other students on previous\noccasions. Students should be aware that plagiarism is a serious offence and severe\npenalties may be imposed.\nFurther information on what constitutes plagiarism and cheating is online at the\nfollowing\nurl:\nhttp://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/about/teaching/plagiarism/plagiarism.cfm\n8.

While also gaining practical experiences, the students\nwill develop the understanding from reflecting, applying, contrasting, and comparing\ntheories and concepts taught in COMENT 703, 705, 706 and 708 to a hands-on project.\nMoreover, the students will also develop project management skill to enable them to scope\nand plan commercialisation, set milestones and to prepare and communicate material in\nboth written and oral forms to create value for stakeholders.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that students have developed the following\ncompetences in relation to the particular project and client:\n1. Plan for effective research commercialisation project management.\n2. Undertake validation and valuation and develop strategies for commercialisation\npathways and risk and contingency management in a highly uncertain and unstructured\nenvironment.\n3. Be able to apply and reflect on theories and concepts learned in COMENT 703, 704, 706\nand 708 to analyse challenges and derive recommendations.\n4. Engage in team effort, develop and engage in knowledge sharing and learning practices,\nperform to the expectation of peers and manage intra-group relationships and conflicts.\n5. Compose and present their work in both written and oral form to various stakeholders\nthroughout the project.\n\nTeaching and Learning\nThis course is based around practical research commercialisation projects. Each project will\nbe different and will be associated with different challenges. This course is intended for\nstudents to gain some practical experiences with research commercialisation. The teaching\nand learning components are designed to allow students to engage in reflective,\nexperimental and peer-to-peer learning, feedback activities and knowledge sharing.\n\n\fTo assist with the project management, the students will be introduced to an online tool\ncalled Basecamp. Basecamp will be instrumental in the course for the facilitation of\nknowledge sharing and peer-to-peer learning. A demonstration of Basecamp will take place\nin the first workshop.\nTeaching and learning are divided into three components: (1) Workshops, (2) individual\nand team learning, and (3) supervision.\na) Workshops\nThe first workshop will introduce some systems and techniques for enabling project\nmanagement, learning and knowledge sharing. The second workshops will provide the\nstudents with some basic tools and methods to undertake primary and secondary research\nand determine commercialisation pathways. During the third workshop the students will\nmake a presentation of their technology and the project scope. Workshops 4, 5 and 6will\nserve as an interactive forum where students and experts will be present to discuss\nparticular topics related to each group and project. At the final workshop, the students will\nbe presenting their report to the client and a panel of judges. All classes are scheduled\nfrom 3 \u2013 6 pm. Dates for the workshops are listed below.\n\n1\n\nTime\n\nTopic\n\nContent\n\n7 April 3-6pm\n\nIntroduction\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nFormation of groups\nProject management\n\nWorkshop\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nResearch and market validation\nCommercialisation Strategies\n\n5 May 3-6pm\n\nWorkshop\n\nCase room 1/260-005\n\nProject scope presentation\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\n2 June 3-6pm\n\nProject presentation\n\nGroup based workshop\nPresenting the project scope and white paper\nof the technology\nPresenting early outcomes of ideation and\n\nCase room 1/260-005\n2\n\n21 April 3-6pm\nCase room 1/260-005\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\uf0b7\n\nearly market validation\n\nCase room 1/260-005\n5\n\n30 June 3-6pm\n\nMilestone presentation\n\n\uf0b7\n\nvalidation (assessed by external panel)\n\nCase room 1/260-005\n6\n\n28 July 3-6pm\n\nMilestone presentation\n\n\uf0b7\n\n25 August 3-6pm\n\nPresenting tentative pathways and strategies\n(assessed by external panel)\n\nCase room 1/260-005\n7\n\nPresenting outcomes of ideation and market\n\nPresenting the report\n\nCase room 1/260-005\n\n\uf0b7\n\nPresent final report to stakeholders (assessed\nby external panel)\n\nReading and teaching material will be available via Canvas prior to each workshop.\nb) Individual and team learning\nIndividual and peer-to-peer learning are important aspects of this course. To keep track of\nthe learning the students will be required to manage a Commercialisation Log, which will\nbe integrated into Basecamp. The commercialisation log will consists of two parts: (1) a\nProject Log that is accessible by all team members, project sponsor and Instructors, and\n(2) a Personal Log that is accessible only to each individual student and the Instructors.\nThe logs will make up assignment 1.\nc) Supervision\nThis is a supervised project. The Instructor will be responsible for providing or facilitating\nsupervision for each project. The primary responsibility of the supervisor of this course is\nto ensure overall guidance to the project teams to ensure the projects stay on track and\n\n2|Page\n\n\fwithin the scope of the course and the expectations of the Project Sponsors. The following\nidentifies the key functions of the supervisor in this course:\na) Provide overall guidance of the project in form of clear instructions of purpose and\nscope to both students and Project Sponsors.\nb) During workshops, advise students to relevant areas of information and appropriate\ntechniques and methods.\nc) Regularly monitor the progression of each project in Basecamp.\nd) Provide feedback to students for each assessment in either written or oral form.\ne) Mediate in case of conflicts between Project Sponsor and Project Team.\nNo time have been set aside for individual/group consultations or supervision outside the\nworkshops and Basecamp. However, in case of unexpected circumstances please contact\nthe Instructor to discuss further.\nd) Quarter Break\nA Quarter Break has been scheduled from 5 \u2013 18 June. You are not expected to be working\non the project during this period.\n\nDescription of projects\nProject description\nProjects will be sourced from universities, CRIs or science and technology based\nenterprises. The projects will be around technologies or research output that recently have\nbeen disclosed but yet belong to an early research commercialisation stage with some\ninitial understanding of the commercial potential of application. More details of the projects\nwill be circulated to the students prior to the first workshop.\nThe students will be working directly with the project sponsor. Contact to the project\nsponsor should be initiated after the first workshop.\nResearch involving human participants (including teaching sessions, laboratories,\nanonymous questionnaires, research carried out as part of coursework) must receive\napproval from the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee (UAHPEC).\nFor COMENT 705, Ethics have been approved under the reference number 8137, which\nmeans that students in this course are allowed to undertake research involving human\nparticipants. However, the students must follow the procedure specified by the UAHPEC,\nwhich involves informing the participants about the purpose of the research (Participant\nInformation Sheet) and have them to sign a consent form before partaking.\nThe Participation Information Sheet and the Consent Form have been prepared and the\nstudent should not undertake any research that relates to the projects and involves human\nparticipants before the first workshop.\nTeam formation\nThe teams will be formed in the first workshop. The students are advised to prioritise the\nproject according to their preferences prior to the first workshop. To the extent possible\nthe teams will be formed based on the students preferred choice. In case of conflicts of\ninterest a student might be restricted to work for certain projects.\nWhen the teams are formed, each team is required to align, discuss and write down a Team\nAgreement. Instructions to the Team Agreement can be found under Assessments.\n\n3|Page\n\n\fInstructors\nDr Brian Karlson (Course Coordinator)\nEmail: b.karlson@auckland.ac.nz\nConsultation by appointment\nDr Cristiano Bellavitis\nEmail: c.bellavitis@auckland.ac.nz\nConsultation by appointment\n\nOther faculty staff and external experts will be involved on an ad-hoc basis.\n\nAssessment\nThe students will be assessed on (1) their input to the project, (2) the actual output of the\nproject and its value to the project sponsors, and (3) their ability to reflect on the learning\nprocess.

It is expected that each student continuously work on the project throughout the\nproject period.\nThe commercialisation log consists of two components: (1) A Project Log that is accessible\nto the team, Instructors and selected external stakeholders and (2) a Personal Log that is\nonly accessible to each individual team member and the Instructors.\nAssessment deadlines\nIt is recommended to update the log regularly and not to wait to the last minute. The\ndeadlines for the updates and mark allocations are as follows:\n\n4 May\n1 June\nQuarter Break (5.6-18.6)\n29 June\n20 July\n17 August\n\nTotal\n\nPersonal Log\nAllocated marks\n3\n3\n\nProject Log\nAllocated marks\n3\n3\n\n3\n3\n3\n\n3\n3\n3\n\n15 Points\n\n15 Points\n\nAs both logs are introduced to ensure continuously learning, late submissions are not\naccepted. In case of late submissions they will count towards the next deadline.\nAssessment criteria for the Project Log\nThe Project Log ensures that the individual student is assessed on his/her continuous\ncontributions to the overall project.\nContributions to the project can take various forms:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nUpdates on assigned tasks,\nCompleted assigned tasks and informed group of outcome,\nSuggestions, comments or constructive feedback to team members,\nUseful resources and documents uploaded to the log, etc.\n\nYou must provide a summary of your contributions by the end of the assessment period\nand before the deadline. The summary should be in bullet points and posted in your\nPersonal Log. The Project Log summary has two main purposes: (1) a mechanism for the\nstudent to make a stock take of how much has been achieved in the assessment period\nand (2) to direct the assessor to the key contributions that should be assessed. The Project\nLog summary must be submitted to receive any marks. But the actual assessment is based\non the actual contributions to the project within the assessment period. See below.\n\n5|Page\n\n\fThe Project Log will be assessed as follows:\n\nAs a minimum, each student is\nrequired to provide updates as per\nthe schedule on assigned and\ncompleted tasks. Failure not to\nprovide any input will\nautomatically lead to zero marks.\nMarks will be given in the range of\n0-3.\n\nFull marks\n\uf0b7\nInformative\n\uf0b7\nAnalytic\n\uf0b7\nConstructive\n\uf0b7\nAdds value to\nprogress and\nteam\n\nHalf marks\n\uf0b7\nInformative\n\uf0b7\nDescriptive\n\nZero marks\n\uf0b7\nNo input\n\nExample on update on assigned tasks:\nHi team,\nI am half way through with the market validation. As per discussions I emailed Mark Hardie from the ICEHouse\nto begin with for some tips on how to approach this task. He was very helpful and pointed me in different\ndirections. He also sent through some useful learning resources, which I have uploaded to Basecamp. So far I\nhave gathered market intelligence to help assess market share and market value for 3 out of the 4 markets we\nhave decided to investigate. The interim report is attached. I should still be on track to complete this task, but it\nall depends on how difficult it will be to set up further meetings with industry experts the next couple of weeks.\nIt would be great if anyone knows of someone in the food industry that might be interested in the Sensor\nTechnology that we could interview. Please let me know.\nExample on completion of assigned tasks:\nHi All,\nI have completed the analysis of the IP landscape. My full analysis including descriptions of the approach is\nattached. In summary:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nIn general the market for turning feedstock into chemicals or fuel is competitive with thousands of actors.\nHowever, the market is highly concentrated around using sugars as a feedstock, which is turned into either\nchemicals or fuel.\nOnly very few actors are using gas as a feedstock. Those present in that area are attempting to turn gas into\nfull and not chemicals.\nFrom a perspective of \u201cFreedom to operate\u201d, I would recommend to investigate the market for gas to\nchemicals further.\n\nRegards\nExample on suggestions, comments or constructive feedback to team members:\nHi Peter,\nYour analysis of the IP landscape is very insightful. While I think the gas-to-chemicals is worth further\ninvestigation, I think we have to be very cautious with jumping the gun here. I was wondering if we could find\nout why no-one else to-date has tried to explore this market previously. Is it because no-one else have thought\nabout it (which I doubt)? Are there some technical or regulatory restrictions? Or has it just proven not financial\nfeasible? I suggest we spend more time on validating the market from a technical perspective. What do you guys\nthink?\nExample on useful resources and documents uploaded to the log, etc.\nHi Team,\nI came across a report outlining the strategic focus of the NZ Government from 2014-2020. These are the key\npoints from the report that might be of interest to us.\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\nEspecially I would recommend all to read section C + D (p. 12-25). Let\u2019s discuss at our next meeting.\n\n6|Page\n\n\fAssessment criteria for the Personal Log\nThe Personal Log forms basis for assessing the reflection in the learning process of the\nindividual student.\nReflection is important to the learning process as it enables us to learn from our\nexperiences. Developing reflective learning routines means developing ways of reviewing\nour own learning to ensure continuous development, which is an important learning\nobjective of this course.\nThe Personal Log is a tool to help you structure your reflective learning and receive\nfeedback from the Instructor on the process. The reflective learning involves four different\nprocesses:\n1. Concrete experience\n2. Reflective observation\n3. Abstract conceptualisation\n4. Active experimentation\nStart each of the paragraphs in your Personal Log with a reference to one of the learning\ncycles above (as illustrated below).\nA log should be between 500-1,000 words. However it comes down to the quality\nrather than quantity of the log.\nAssessment criteria for the Personal Log are as follows:\n\nYou are required to update your\nPersonal Log as per the schedule.\nFailure to provide any input will\nautomatically lead to zero marks.\nMarks will be given in the range of\n0-3.\n\nFull marks\n\uf0b7\nInvolves\nminimum three\nof the four\nlearning\nprocesses\n\uf0b7\nOriginate from\nan experience/\nchallenge\nrelevant to the\nproject\n\uf0b7\nMore than 3\nreferences to\npast learning in\nthe programme\n(COMENT\n703,4,6 or 8)\nand literature\n\nHalf marks\n\uf0b7\nInvolves\nminimum two\nof the four\nlearning\nprocesses\n\uf0b7\nOriginate from\nan experience/\nchallenge less\nrelevant to the\nproject\n\uf0b7\nNo or less than\n3 references to\npast learning in\nthe programme\n(COMENT\n703,4,6 or 8)\nand literature\n\nZero marks\n\uf0b7\nNo input\n\nExample on Personal Log\n1 March 2016\nConcrete experience\nI have been assigned the task to identify possible commercialisation pathways for the technology. Initially within\nthe group and with the client we discussed license agreements to be the preferred option but also other options\nwere discussed such as partnerships and joint ventures.\nMy experience with commercialisation pathways is mainly theoretical from COMENT 703. Different pathways\nprovide different advantages, e.g. licensing provide a more immediate and constant revenue stream to the owner\ncompared to continuing developing the technology internally or with external partners, which involves more risk\nbut also potential higher return on investment.\n\n7|Page\n\n\fReflective observation\nThis was the starting point for our discussion, but it made me wonder what actually determines what\ncommercialisation pathway to choose. To me it does not seem to be pre-determined or a discrete choice.\nEspecially I recall our discussion from COMENT 704 on uncertainty and effectuation that the path ahead sometimes\nis not to be discovered but created, which support that we cannot just decide on a pathway just like that\nAbstract conceptualisation\nThe same thing applies to our project. Our discussions are not really relevant as they have been around which\npathway is most attractive, and not about what pathway is actually available and feasible. At the end I would\nsuspect that the pathway depends on whether anyone actually wants to buy or license our technology, or what\nwe need to improve to make it attractive to the market. This is quite opposite of what I got out of session 4 in\nCOMENT 703\nActive experimentation\nI sat out to test my assumption about commercialisation pathways by asking potential customers if they would\nlike to buy our technology. My approach is inspired by the effectuation logic from COMENT 704, which is applicable\nto highly uncertain situations. The reactions from all the potential customers were that the technology has a lot\nof possibilities. But these possibilities are best explored in a partnership with the technology owner and the\ncustomer rather than through a license agreement, because the technology is not well understood and requires\nsubstantial further development at this stage. One customer was particularly interested and would like to set up\na joint venture with our project sponsor which involves sharing cost to further R&D\nThe conclusion of this whole exercise is that commercialisation pathways is not something that is decided on by\nthe inventor, but something that is created over time via market interactions [Beginning of new cycle].\n\nExamples of topics suitable for the Personal Log\nTechnology assessment\n\uf0b7 How much of the science need to be understood to undertake commercialisation\nhereof?\n\uf0b7 The importance of engaging the inventor in early stage research commercialisation\n\uf0b7 Using patent landscapes to understand the scope of the technology\nIdeation\n\uf0b7 Ideation exercise \u2013 identify potential areas of application\n\uf0b7 What framework is most suitable to screen and select ideas for application?\n\uf0b7 How to navigate in fuzzy front-end?

This\ncourse is one that really gives you all that you need to excel on the outset itself. There's no\nneed to dig deeper or search for explanations anywhere else because everything you need\n(materials + examples) are provided. The best way to study for this course in my opinion is to\nattend the classes, try the example documents, rework them near test times using the\nrecordings and doing the tutorial problems. I also found myself highlighting the slides during\nthe lectures for any possible word questions that could be asked so that I could skim through\nthose before tests. Lastly, I'd highly recommend not being complacent as to the journal\nentries; it's easy to be a bit relaxed during the test because of the sheet of paper available, but\nlearning the journal entries needed at an early stage really speeds you up and makes you more\nprepared come exam time.\n\n-It was one of the best accounting courses for me and would like to encourage future students\nto start studying early as there were lots of topics to cover. For preparing tests and exams, its\nbest to print out all the example documents, assignments, tutorials and actually have a go\nwithout looking at the answers.\n-With the computational aspects of accounting, you need to practise and comprehend the\nrationale behind each problem you do in order to master it. For example, in addition to\nreviewing the tutorial, assignment and example document problems, one should spend some\ntime thinking about possible extensions to these questions to cover any concepts that were\ndiscussed but not explicitly assessed in that pertinent assessment. If a student mechanistically\nregurgitates content without understanding the underlying principles of accounting they will\nfind it difficult to apply their knowledge in different scenarios, irrespective of the amount of\ntime they have spent studying.\n\n-Practice, practice, practice and even more practice. Redo the example documents,\nassignments and tutorial problems until you can do them in your sleep. Be consistent with\nyour study, attend lectures/tutorials and ask about anything you don't understand. Having a\nthorough understanding of each topic - which can be achieved through practice - is the key to\ndoing well in Accounting 211.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/FINANCE761.pdf", "text": "Course Outline\nFinance 761: PORTFOLIO THEORY AND INVESTMENT ANALYSIS\n(15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\n\nThis course covers contemporaneous issues in investments and builds on knowledge acquired\nin Finance 261 and 361. This is a graduate course geared towards students who will conduct\nresearch in the form of dissertation or thesis. The course is designed to give students exposure\nto a wide variety of research in the area of empirical asset pricing. The course is based on\nseminars in which the students present assigned papers.\nLocation and Time\nOGGB Room 205, Thursday 9 am -12 pm\nAssessment\nThe total course mark used to determine your overall grade is calculated as follows\nMARKS\nAssignments (10 + 5 + 15)\n\n30\n\nParticipation\n\n10\n\nPresentations\n\n20\n\nTest\n\n40\nTotal Course Mark\n\n100\n\nPresentation\nFrom Week 4 onwards each student will be responsible for two presentations which are\nexpected to go beyond the paper as opposed to giving a mere summary of the paper. In\nparticular, the presenters should address questions such as: What is the importance of the\npaper? How does it relate to the literature in the area? (A brief overview of related papers is\nnecessary to address this question.) What are the practical implications of the paper? Are there\nany unanswered questions? Can the research design be improved? Are there any ambiguities?\nSeminar presenters are also expected to lead active class discussion in which everyone\nparticipates. (Note reading slides or notes will discourage others from participating.) Engaging\nother students and keeping lively discussion going is an important factor determining\n\n\fpresentation grades. Presenters are encouraged to see the lecturer and discuss their assigned\npapers well ahead of time.\nYou will do a group presentation on a topic in the area of \u201cHedge Funds\u201d.\n\nParticipation\nThis course relies heavily on students' participation in seminars. Learning in a seminar is an\nevolving process which includes outside preparation and seminar discussions. Everyone is\nexpected to ask questions, raise issues, contribute and challenge the opinions of others.\nParticipation grades will be determined by a combination of evident preparation, frequency and\nquality of participation. Participation will account for 10% of your final grade.\nNote Out of respect for all participants in FIN761, mobiles need to be switched off during class\nand laptops/tablets are not allowed!\n\nAssignments\nStudents who do not have presentation responsibility are required to provide a critique with at\nleast two questions for each paper. A good question helps others better understand the paper\nand/or leads to interesting class discussion. At least one of the questions must be brought up\nfor discussion during the in class seminar presentation. Questions may relate to the motivation\nof the paper, or a specific detail of the methodology used. Alternatively you may have a query\nas to the relevance of the research to New Zealand or the possibility of conducting similar\nresearch using a different data set. The written questions must be handed in at the start of each\nsession. This counts for 10% of your final grade.\nYou also have to write a referee report. The referee report should be no longer than three\npages, one and a half spaced. The paper for the referee report will be distributed in class later\non. The referee report counts for 5% of your final grade.\nThe remaining 15% is allocated to an empirical assignment. The assignment will require the\nuse of computers. We recommend that you use SAS, although any statistical programming\nlanguage such as R, Matlab, EViews, Stata or Gauss will work as well. Excel may also work\nbut it will be impractical and tedious without macro programming. Details about the empirical\nassignment will be announced later.\nTest\nThe test is open-book and counts for 40% of your final grade.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nAt the successful completion of the course, students should be able to\n1.\nUnderstand the core principles of asset pricing\n2.\nUnderstand current empirical research in the area of asset pricing\n3.\nCritically evaluate claims of successful investment strategies\n4.\nCome up with interesting research questions in the field of asset pricing\n\n\fIn addition to developing your knowledge of and research skills in asset pricing, Finance 761\naims to develop generic skills as required by relevant professional bodies and the University\nof Auckland Business School (UABS). At the end of the course, you should be able to\n5.\nDemonstrate verbal, written, and interpersonal communication skills, at a level where\nyou can communicate knowledge clearly and succinctly.\nTeaching Staff\nProfessor Henk Berkman\nRoom 577, Owen G.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\n\fInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face- to-face\nand/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nStudent Feedback\nFormative feedback surveys\nDuring the early part of the quarter (usually Week 3 or 4), short feedback surveys are\nadministered to all students to get a snapshot of how they are coping with their new\ncourses. This qualitative data, which is administered, collected and collated by the\nProgramme Office, is designed as an \u2018early warning\u2019 system of any significant issues with\nthe course that might need addressing quickly. Lecturers are asked to provide a brief\nreport to the Director GSM MBA on key items identified and proposed actions. Lecturers\nare also asked to provide a verbal report to the class, proposing any solutions as\nappropriate.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nThe University of Auckland evaluates the quality of teaching and of courses by using the\nSummative Evaluation Tool, or SET. Summative evaluation is formal, summative\nevaluation of teaching undertaken according to University policy and is conducted at the\nend of a semester/quarter through the use of the formal University SET instruments.\nSummative evaluation is used by teachers to reflect on their teaching practice, and is also\nused by the University for quality assurance of teaching and courses.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/PROPERTY753.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nPROPERTY 753: SEMINAR IN PROPERTY FINANCE AND\nINVESTMENT (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nCourse Prescription\n\nAdvanced studies in the theory and practice of property finance and investment.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\nPrerequisite: PROPERTY 351 (Preferred B+ or above)\nThis course is recommended for students who are interested in understanding and\napplying property finance and investment theories at the postgraduate level or who are\ninterested in developing critical research skills in the area of property finance and\ninvestment.\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nThis course covers property finance and investment theories, methodology and empirical\nevidence.

I do my best to\nstrike the right balance. To assist with getting everyone to the starting line,\nI shall be running a two hour session before we commence Quarter 2 for\nthose unfamiliar and/or rusty with Accounting and Financial Reporting. This\nshould help with getting everyone to the start line on the first day of class.\nI shall be notifying the class when and where I shall be running this preclass session.\n\n2.\n\nWhile participation is encouraged in class, students have asked that marks\nshould not be awarded for it because some may be reluctant to participate\n\n\fif they feel they will be penalised for saying something that may not be\ncorrect. This may hold back their willingness to engage and contribute,\nwhich is a valuable aspect of learning. This year\u2019s assessment does not\ninclude an allocation for class participation. Nevertheless, it is strongly\nencouraged.\n3.\n\nStudents would like more worked examples and tutorials. I shall be running\nfortnightly tutorials on an evening between 5.30 pm and 7.30 pm. Tutorials\nreinforce the concepts covered in the formal class setting and allow more\nopportunities for asking questions and for practising with more problems\nand real life examples.\nI shall also run an additional tutorial before the final test at the end of\nQuarter 2, probably on a Saturday.\nTutorial sessions are voluntary. Student feedback is that they are valuable.\n\n4.\n\nThat I explain the Excel formulae when using Excel. I shall do my best,\nalthough I would expect students to have some basic understanding of\nExcel.\n\n5.\n\nSome have suggested a more succinct textbook. In my 30 plus years as an\nacademic, this is a perennial challenge. The EHMHM textbook is one of the\nbest I have used for an MBA class. I have prescribed selected chapters\nbecause it is impossible to cover all the topics in the book with only 30\nhours of class time.\n\n6.\n\nIf you have any concerns, please provide me with your feedback\nimmediately rather than waiting for a formal Staff-Student Consultative\nMeeting to air the issues. As your lecturer, I would like to be the first\nperson to hear from you of any concerns you have rather than getting them\nfrom the minutes of a Staff-Student Consultative Meeting.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\nCHEATING AND PLAGIARISM\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may\nbe reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\n\n\fmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an\nelectronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for\nfurther information about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to\navoid plagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSMKT711.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nBUSMKT 711 Consultancy Project for MMktg\nQuarter 3 (1176)\n\nCourse Prescription\nA research-informed consultancy project based on a marketing internship with a company\nor other appropriate organisation with written and oral reports of the findings.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: BUSMGT 751, 752, 754, 761 with at least a B average\nRestriction: BUSMKT 703,704\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with the opportunity to complete an\napplied research-informed consultancy project.

Each supervisor will be seen on alternating weeks.\nAdditional meetings can also be arranged when needed\nCompany Supervisor\nStudents will also be in contact with a company supervisor. Their company supervisor will\nact as their main point of contact inside their partnered firm. It will be the student\u2019s\nresponsibility to ensure that they meet with this person regularly.\n\nE-Portfolio\nAll students will be expected to contribute weekly to a compulsory individual e-portfolio.\nThis will be set up in the first week of the quarter in a Workshop. Contributions to the e-\n\n\fportfolio will be the students\u2019 record of their ongoing progress and notes, and will form the\nbasis of the academic supervisory meetings each week. In addition, students will be\nprovided with regular feedback on their e-portfolios throughout the course.\nStudents will be provided with a structured set of e-portfolio requirements which are to be\ncompleted before the academic supervisory meetings each week.

The work that a student submits for grading\nmust be the student's own work, reflecting his or her learning. Where work from other sources is\nused, it must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This requirement also applies to sources\non the world-wide web. A student's assessed work may be reviewed against electronic source\nmaterial using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be\nrequired to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review.\n\n\fIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your courses\nthroughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions, the University has contingency plans to\nensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is fair, and not compromised.\nSome adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In the event of a disruption, the\nUniversity and your course coordinators will make every effort to provide you with up-to-date\ninformation via Canvas and the university website.\n\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\n\n\fThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party, you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available\nat: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/OPSMGT258.pdf", "text": "Course Outline\n2017\nOPSMGT 258: BUSINESS PROCESS DESIGN (15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCourse Prescription\n\nIntroduces the elements of business process management through mapping and design.\nEmphasis is on how organisations identify, design and improve essential business\nprocesses. Includes the use of software tools to model and analyse processes for\ncontinuous performance improvements.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\nPrerequisite: INFOSYS 110 or 120 and STATS 108 or 101 or 191.\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nThe course aims to provide a basic, broad-based understanding of business process design\nand management that will serve as a good foundation for specialist Stage-III courses in\norganisational transformation, Enterprise Systems and IS design and management etc.\nThus, the course has multiple objectives, which include providing students with:\n\uf0b7 the fundamentals of process thinking and process management;\n\uf0b7 a basic understanding of links between organisational strategy and business process\nimprovement initiatives;\n\uf0b7 techniques for analysing, improving and redesigning processes;\n\uf0b7 knowledge of how to execute business process redesign projects;\n\uf0b7 formal process modelling skills using state-of-the-art software to represent and\nanalyse both as-is and to-be processes;\n\uf0b7 knowledge and modelling of inter and intra enterprise business processes; and\n\uf0b7 basic knowledge of how to manage the organisational change that is induced by\nprocess redesign.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. understand the concepts, views, and latest methodologies of business process design;\n2. participate in and contribute to process design/redesign efforts in organisations;\n3. understand key concepts in the design and utilisation of best business practices\nembedded in the lean philosophy;\n4. understand the key processes involved in business networks;\n5. have an appreciation of issues pertaining to organisational design and organisational\nchange management in the context of business process management and\n6. utilise software tools to assist in business process design.\n\nContent Outline\nWeek\nWeeks\nWeeks\nWeeks\nWeeks\n\n1\nIntroduction to Business Processes\n2 \u2013 3 Introduction to Business Process Design\n4 \u2013 5 Business Process Management for e-business\n7 \u2013 10 Methodology and Tools for Business Process redesign\n11 \u2013 12 Business Process redesign and Organisational Change\n\n\fLearning and Teaching\n\nLectures:\n12 @ three hours per week\nLabs:\n8 @ one hour per week\nOptional Lab Workshops: 8 @ one hour per week (second hour of the 2hr block)\nLectures are active learning times and therefore recordings, where provided, should only\nbe used as revision tool. Labs provide examples to practice various technical and analysis\nskills and give opportunity to practice team work skills. The process modelling software\nused in the course is available in the Labs in OGGB, Level 0. The expectation is that\nstudents spend an average of 7-9 hours per week on the course outside of class (split\nbetween reading/studying/practicing and assignments).\nSignificant research has now accumulated to show that people learn best by self-discovery\nor \u201cactive learning\u201d. This class will use active learning techniques. At times students find\nthis frustrating because they are working on a case or exercise in Lab before the detailed\ntheory material has been presented in Lecture. However, this is the whole point of active\nlearning. The only way a skill is developed \u2013 skiing, cooking, writing, critical thinking,\nsolving thermodynamics problems, or understanding operational issues \u2013 is practice: trying\nsomething, seeing how well or poorly it works, reflecting on how to do it differently, then\ntrying it again and seeing if it works better. Further, studies have shown that if something\nis learned through self-discovery it will be retained much better than if it simply presented\nas fact.\n\nTeaching Staff\nName\nRole\nLocation\nEmail\nPhone\n\nGabrielle Peko\nLecturer\nOGGB Room 464\ng.peko@auckland.ac.nz\n373-7599 ext 85065\n\nName\nRole\nEmail\n\nJC Favier\nLab tutor\nN/A\n\nName\nRole\nLocation\nEmail\nPhone\n\nUrsula Dantin\nCourse Coordinator\nOGGB Room 441\nu.dantin@auckland.ac.nz\n373-7599 ext 84235\n\nLearning Resources\n\nThere is no text for the course, however there are a number of prescribed book chapters,\nreproduced in the coursebook, and readings.

The Course deals mainly with New Zealand GST but analogous taxes in other\njurisdictions (notably Australian GST and UK VAT) are referred to for comparative purposes.\nMajor topics include: taxable activities, input tax, output tax, registration, adjustments,\ntaxable supplies, timing and the GST anti-avoidance provisions.\nGoals of the Course\nThe paper is an advanced course studying all major aspects of the Goods and Services Tax\nAct 1985. The objectives of the course are to provide students with both a theoretical\nbackground and high level of technical knowledge of the GST Act. Comparisons with other\nindirect taxes and overseas variations of GST provide a deeper understanding of the policy\nbehind the New Zealand GST regime.\nThe course provides students with an opportunity to increase their research, writing and group\npresentation skills by the completion of a major paper on various aspects of the GST regime.\nThis final exam requires students to apply all aspects of the GST Act they have mastered\nduring the course. Emphasis is therefore placed on good analytical skills and presentation of\nresearched, comprehensive and well reasoned solutions.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents who take and pass this course will be able to:\n1. Identify and comprehend the major aspects of the GST Act\n2. Understand the meaning of \u201ctaxable activity\u201d, the rules governing taxable supplies,\nzero-rated transactions and time of supply\n3. Analyse the policy and principles underlying the GST regime\n4. Apply their knowledge in the preparation of a GST return, including all input tax,\noutput tax and adjustments\n5.

Considers\nthe challenges and constraints that managers face in increasingly complex environments\nand industries.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisites: BUSINESS 102\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nBroadly, the goal of this course is for students to analyse firms and industries in a wide\nrange of contexts, using the tools and theories presented in this course. Based on those\nanalyses, students should formulate and explain strategic courses of action.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. demonstrate a solid theoretical understanding of the core strategy concepts;\n2. demonstrate an ability to apply the core strategy concepts to real-life situations and\ncase studies;\n3. demonstrate an ability to work with the core strategic concepts as a part of a team.\n\nContent Outline\n\nWeek\nTopic\nReadings\n1\nIntroduction to the course\nCourse syllabus and outline\n2\nIntroducing strategy\nChapter 1\n3\nThe environment\nChapter 2*\n4\nStrategic capabilities\nChapter 3*\n5\nStrategic purpose\nChapter 4*\n6\nBusiness strategy\nChapter 5*\n7\nCorporate strategy and diversification\nChapter 6\n8\nInternational strategy\nChapter 7\n9\nInnovation strategies\nChapter 8\n10\nMergers, acquisitions and alliances\nChapter 9\n11\nStrategy in action\nChapter 10\n12\nCourse review\n*Case Study GLO-BUS Simulation Decision Deadlines will be on Tuesdays and\nThursdays at 9pm in Weeks 3,4,5 and 6.\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nThis course is designed on the principles of team-based learning, which emphasise\nindividual responsibility for content and both individual and team resourcefulness in\n1\n\n\fapplying content. Teams of five to seven students are formed the first week of class. You\nwill work in the same team for the duration of the course.\nThere is a distinctive rhythm to class sessions. For each new section, you will read ahead\nto understand concepts independently. Then, in the first one-hour session you will take a\n5-Question Multiple Choice test, first individually and then as a team. A lecture during the\nremaining time of this class will complete your understanding of the content. The following\ntwo-hour session will be devoted to applying the concepts of the readings to real-world\norganisations with examples and case studies.\nPeer reviews in Week 4, 8 and 12 ensure your final grade reflects both your individual\ncompetence and your contribution to your team\u2019s performance.\nTeam-based learning will not only help you understand the concepts but also give you a\nchance to learn concepts experientially during the application exercises. In addition, this\napproach will give you experience in the real-world challenges of integrating multiple\nperspectives into a single course of action: a situation very typical to strategy making and\nimplementation. Top grades are awarded to individuals who demonstrate mastery of the\ncourse content.\nClass time is scheduled to reap the benefit of team interaction. This means you should be\nprepared to do self-guided study outside of class hours. On average you should spend\nabout seven hours per week on pre-reading and learning concepts independently, with\nsome weeks requiring a larger time commitment than others.\n\nTeaching Staff\n\nDaniel Tisch\nRoom 488, The Owen G.

Textbook\nThe required textbook for this course is:\nJohnson, G., Whittington, R., & Scholes, K. (2015). Fundamentals of Strategy (3rd ed).\nHarlow, UK: FT Prentice Hall.\n\neBook: http://www.pearsoned.co.nz/products/?sq=9781292017259\nThe textbook is heavily used throughout the course; e.g., the weekly quizzes are based on\npre-reading the book and the examination focuses on concepts from the textbook.\nAlthough there are copies of the text available from the Library (both for short- and regularloan), most students find it convenient to buy a copy of the textbook.\n2. Case study: Your Company in the Digital Camera Drone Industry\nhttp://new.glo-bus.com/ (BE CAREFUL! This is NOT http://www.glo-bus.com/)\nYour company in the new GLO-BUS simulation will serve as a case study in applying\nconcepts in graded application exercises \u2013 you compete against classmates as a maker of\nwearable video cameras that expands into camera-equipped drones. Individual access\nto the GLO-BUS simulation ($US 9.50) is required for this course and payable\nonline by credit card when you create a student account.\nAny additional readings will be provided through Canvas.\n2\n\n\fAssessment\nThe assessment of your performance in this course is based on three elements: (1) your\nindividual performance, (2) your team\u2019s performance, and (3) your contribution to the\nteam\u2019s performance using peer evaluations with the teaching staff\u2019s final approval.\n(1) Individual performance will count for 65% of the final grade based on:\n\u2022 10% for individual readiness assessments tests (final mark will count 9 top scores\nout of 10 weekly 5-Question Multiple Choice tests)\n\u2022 10% for 2 individual application exercises (5% in Week 6 and 5% in Week 9)\n\u2022 45% for the final examination.\n(2) Team performance will count for 35% of the final grade consisting of:\n\u2022 5% for group readiness assessment tests\n\u2022 5% for your company performance in the GLO-BUS simulation\n\u2022 25% for up to 8 in-class assessed application exercises. There will be more than 8\napplication exercises, yet some serve to stage other exercises and will not be\nassessed.\n(3) Peer evaluation will result in a shift of \u00b15% of your overall grade awarded upon\napproval from the Lecturer. Group members will answer 5 questions online in Week 4,\n8 and 12, answered privately and presented back to members anonymously. Four\nanswers are descriptive and suggestive of how to improve teamwork. One answer is\nthe percentage of the team performance (see 35% above) that you think each member\ndeserves. For example, if you think that Student A contributed more than Student B\nthen you could award 110% to Student A and 90% to Student B. If everybody in the\ngroup answered in the same way, Student A would get 110% of the team performance\nmarks and Student B would get 90%. Results are \u2018normalised\u2019 so that every member\ncannot receive over 100% of the team marks. For example, the system lowers all\nmembers\u2019 contribution percentages when everybody enters over 100% for everybody\nelse \u2013 the system calculates relative entries and avoids \u2018gaming the system\u2019. For\nprecisely how the multiplier is calculated refer to:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjQQHYM3YId0EUSrGnJWG5AeFpDD_G7xg_d-7jg3vU/pub?embedded=true#h.n5u2xs6z9y0g.\nThe Peer Evaluation multiplier is applied in the final week of the semester as the\naverage of all inputs from Week 4, 8 and 12. Your peers don\u2019t get peer marks if you\ndon\u2019t submit them. If you miss ONE peer evaluation week then you will still get peer\nmarks from those who submit. However, you will be assigned a mark of zero if you\nmiss a SECOND peer evaluation week. The Lecturer will intervene in all cases to ensure\nfairness.\nThe broad relationship between these assessments and the course learning outcomes are\nas follows:\nAssessment\nIndividual readiness assessments\nIndividual application exercises\nFinal examination\nGroup readiness assessments\nAssessed application exercises\n\nType\nIndividual\nIndividual\nIndividual\nGroup\nGroup\n\nLearning outcomes\n1&2\n1&2\n1, 2 & 3\n1, 2 & 3\n1, 2 & 3\n\nWhat if I missed a class?\nFor the weekly 5 Multiple Choice Questions, only 9 out of 10 tests are counted. So if you\nmissed one week, nothing happens: your mark does not get affected. Please note that if\nyou miss more than 1 week you miss your test points. There will be no additional\narrangements to re-take a missed test. If you have a legitimate reason for missing a test\n(e.g. sickness), you need to contact the teaching staff as soon as possible providing written\n3\n\n\fevidence (e.g. doctor\u2019s note or Aegrotat form). If teaching staff determines that you missed\nthe test for a legitimate reason, you will be awarded the average of your end of semester\ntest scores for that week.\nIf you have a legitimate reason for missing the 2 individually assessed application exercises\nor the final exam you will need to apply for aegrotat or compassionate consideration\nthrough\nthe\nUniversity\nHealth\nand\nCounselling\nServices\n(https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/for/current-students/cs-academic-information/csexamination-information/cs-aegrotat-and-compassionate-consideration.html). Note that\nthere are different forms to be filled for written tests (such as the 2 individually assessed\napplication exercises) and final exams. If you are not sure about this process, please\ncontact you teaching staff for guidance.\nYou will get the same marks for the Weekly Application Exercises as the rest of your group\nmembers even if you are absent. If you are a good team player, your team is unlikely to\npunish you for missing a class but you need to make sure you communicate with your\ngroup members, so there are no surprises when it comes to peer evaluations.\nMissed classes are pretty normal once per semester. However, you need to explain to your\ngroup members why you were absent. Most people understand if you have a legitimate\nreason. The main impact on your individual marks from absence during group work comes\nfrom the peer evaluations in Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12. This is when each member\nhas a holistic look at your overall contribution, including absences, which you made toward\nthe group's marks for the period in question. Because the peer evaluation multiplier has a\nsignificant effect on the team performance score you receive, it is recommended that you\npresent relevant evidence to your team members if you miss multiple classes (e.g. doctor's\nnote or Aegrotat form). Even though teaching staff will review and approve all peer\nevaluation marks, you need to convince your group members that your reasons for missing\ngroup work are legitimate. If you feel you are unfairly treated (e.g. if you feel that you\nhave been penalised in the peer evaluations even though you missed classes for legitimate\nreasons), you must let the teaching staff know (again providing relevant evidence to\nsupport your claims). After reviewing the relevant documents teaching staff may alter your\npeer evaluation multiplier unilaterally or may try to resolve the issues with the inclusion of\nall other group members.\n\nInclusive learning\n\nYou are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the teaching staff.\n\nStudent Feedback\n\nAs is usual, you will be asked to complete evaluations relating to the course at the end of\nthe course, and formative/fast feedback.\n\n4\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MGMT309.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nMGMT 309: Organisational ethics and sustainability (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\nCourse Prescription\nConsiders how organisations and individuals can responsibly negotiate the complex\ndemands of changing cultural values, ethical perspectives and real world conditions.\nParticular emphasis will be placed on strategic planning for a sustainable future that\nmoves beyond \u2018Business as Usual\u2019.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: BUSINESS 200 or MGMT 211 or MGMT 231 or any 30 points at Stage II in\nEthics\nRestriction: MGMT 331\n\nGoals of the Course\nThis course aims to empower students to build a clearer perspective on the challenges\nfacing business and modern society as we look towards a future characterised by declining\nresources, growing populations, shifting climates and faltering economic and political\nstructures. As most major international reports on the state of the world agree, \u2018business\nas usual\u2019 will compound these problems rather than alleviate them and this course aims\nto explore the range of possible options that we have to create more adaptive\narrangements for future thriving. The course itself will model these shifts by moving\nbeyond \u2018education as usual\u2019 to challenge students to create for themselves, the vision,\ncommitment and practical thinking necessary to contribute to a genuinely progressive\nworld.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will:\n1. Have a more discerning view of the \u2018big picture\u2019 of contemporary economy,\nculture, society and ecology and of how contemporary trends in each are\nconverging and impacting each other.\n2. Have an enhanced understanding of why current trends are emerging as they are\nand the historical forces that are driving change.\n3. Have a greater appreciation of what is, and what can be done to improve\nprospects for future thriving and of what is required for these strategies to be\nenacted.\n\n\f4. Have clearer insight into the nature of their own ethical beliefs, assumptions and\nvalues and be able to see how these impact upon their own daily lives and on the\nlives of those around them.\n5. Be empowered and inspired to consciously act in more considerate and\nsustainable ways as business people and citizens.\n\nContent Outline\nThe specifics of course content will depend upon the nature of the group and the particular\ndynamics inherent in the class. This responsiveness means that themes will be kept flexible\nto ensure that the emerging learning needs of the group are uppermost at all times. Thus\nthere is no concrete set of readings or list of topics to be discussed on set dates as this\nwould violate a more adaptive flexibility.\nDuring the course however, we will certainly be looking at current and future trends in\nfinance, politics, resources, climate and society and explicitly looking towards how these\nwill impact global well-being in 10-15 years\u2019 time. This focus on the medium term future\nallows for a very practical and meaningful framework to be applied to our deliberations.\nWe will also be looking in depth at a range of psychological, philosophical and spiritual\nviews on ethics from a variety of cultural traditions. This moves the course beyond the\nlimitations of many comparable courses which consider only secular theories in the rational\nwestern tradition and ignore much of the historical and cross-cultural wealth of other\ntraditions.\nWe will study developments in contemporary business that offer useful models for change\nand that recognise the deeper aspects of that appear increasingly necessary if we are to\nbuild a better future for ourselves and others. We will look to inspiring examples and\nconsider the potential we all have to contribute to an improving world as business people\nand everyday members of society.\nThroughout all of this learning, we will spend a large amount of time building perspective\naround these themes and the expectation of students is that you move out of passive\nmodes to become active learners meaning that all ideas are tabled for discussion, debate,\nargument, rejection, expansion and ultimately integration into a meaningful personal\nperspective.\n\nLearning and Teaching\nAs implied above, this course is not designed for the passive learner who wishes above all\nfor \u2018truth\u2019 to be presented to them in non-negotiable form and in signing up for the course,\nit is expected that students will have a mature perspective on the contentious nature of\nvalues and ethics.\nAlthough the class will involve lecture, much of our time will be spent in discussion \u2013 either\nin small, medium or large groups \u2013 as we seek to expand, deepen and broaden our mutual\nunderstanding. This class is founded on the assumption that a roomful of young adults\ncontains a wealth of perspective and that the best learning comes from bringing this\nwisdom forth. We will then be engaging what is known as \u2018co-creative learning\u2019 and\nalthough this might sound a little daunting at the start, experience shows that this is\nusually greatly appreciated by students who find this mode of education liberating,\nempowering and deeply meaningful.\n\n\fThe discussions we will engage will often connect to simple exercises that aim to place\ntheory in the context of your own personal lives and experiences. In these reflective\nexercises you might be asked to act generously, analyse your media habits, take a fresh\nlook at your consumption, have conversations with friends/flatmates on values, or any of\na wide range of similarly creative engagements. These will provide the basis for subjective\nwriting and these will form part of your assessment for the course.\nThe specifics will again be tailored to the learning needs of the group as these emerge and\nthe reflective writings will require a different mode of engagement than that used in more\nconventional courses where you are encouraged to report others ideas and not your own.\nIn this course there is lots of opportunity for introspection and for developing your own\ndeeply-considered perspective.\nAll in all, this course offers a unique blend of formal theory, collective discussion and\npersonal reflection that gives the learner an opportunity to explore key contemporary\nissues in ways that are meaningful, relevant and personally empowering.\n\nTeaching Staff\nThe course is taught and coordinated by Dr Ross McDonald of the MIB Department. Contact\ndetails are:\ne-mail: ra.mcdonald@auckland.ac.nz\nphone: extn 87401\noffice : rm 465 OGGB\n\nLearning Resources\nA wide range of mixed media resources will be posted on Canvas tailored to the on-going\ndiscussions we are having and the learning needs that these reveal. Students are expected\nto keep up with these and there will be occasional spot-tests in class to reward those who\nare. The resources used will come in a range of forms including documentaries, web-sites,\nthe press and formal academic sources. They will be chosen for maximum relevance, rigour\nand accessibility. The hope is that students will not be bored by pretentious and turgid\nacademic writing that brings little in the way of reward or relevance.\n\nAssessment\nThis course does not have a final examination as it is inappropriate to the learning\noutcomes sought. The final grade will be based up a mixture of spot-tests (short in-class\ntests over resources), reflective writings (short statements of personal positions on a\nvariety of issues), a formal essay and a group assignment which will challenge students\nto develop business ideas that can meaningfully contribute to building a more sustainable\nand just world.\nSpot tests = 20%\nReflective Writings \u2013 20%\nEssay \u2013 30%\nGroup Project \u2013 30%\n\n\fFinal details and dates for each component of assessment will be formalised in the first\nfew weeks in consultation with the class. Taken together, these assessments will all\ncontribute to achieving the stated goals of the course.\n\nLearning Outcome\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nSpot-Tests\n1-5\n\nReflective Writings\n\nGroup project\n\n1-5\n\n1-5\n\nInclusive Learning\nWe recognise that in any given class there will be a diverse range of students. Interests\nand abilities. This diversity is a strength which allows us to understand the subject matter\nat hand from a range of different perspectives and bringing these to the fore is an\nimportant aspect of our work in this course.\n\nStudent Feedback\nThis course is designed to be highly responsive to student input both in terms of content\nand process. It is a limited entry class with a maximum of 69 participants and is taught in\na case room in order to maximise the opportunities for collaboration and open exchange\nof views. It is then a format that allows students to have considerable input into the\nlearning dynamics and to help target the flow of learning in ways that are constructive and\nhelpful. A formal evaluation will be conducted at the end of the semester and the feedback\nused to shape future offerings of this course.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/GLMI702.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nGLMI 702: INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT\n(15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\nCourse Prescription\nFocuses on management research and practice with a cross-border and cross-cultural\ndimension.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing:\nwww.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nThird party assistance with coursework: You are encouraged to improve your coursework\nwriting skills and are permitted to seek assistance from third parties. However, you are\nadvised that there are important limits on the amount and type of assistance that can be\ngiven to you in completing your assignments, including group work. Third parties include\nfellow students, reading groups, friends, parents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional\nediting services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired. A copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHelp with academic referencing: Acknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of\nacademic writing. The University\u2019s Referencite website provides students with a one-stop\nonline resource for academic referencing needs. Referencite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples (www.cite.auckland.ac.nz).\n\n4\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSINT704.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2016\nBUSINT 704 INTERNSHIP PROJECT FOR MINTBUS\nQuarter 1 (1162)\nCourse Prescription\nStudents explore the international business environment first-hand as they take\npart in an internship with a company or organization to complete a researchinformed project, and present both written and oral reports of the findings.\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: BUSMGT 741-744\nRestriction: INTBUS 781\nGoals of the Course\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with the opportunity to complete\nan applied research-informed internship project, which requires them to:\n1. Demonstrate broad familiarity with the major concepts, tools, and trends in\ncurrent international business theory and practice;\n2. Use critical and creative thinking to source and evaluate information, and to\nmake linkages in order to begin solving international business problems;\n3. Analyse current international business challenges and propose recommendations\nto address issues\u2019\n4. Develop professional skills in practice and gain experience in delivering\npresentations to both academic and professional audiences.\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of the course, it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. Analyse issues in current international business practice and apply relevant\nselected models and frameworks to derive solutions;\n2. Design and execute a research-informed applied international business project\nwhich will rigorously explore the field and produce analytical insights;\n3. Demonstrate analytical skills necessary for operating within an international\nbusiness context.\n\n\f4. Demonstrate proficiency across a range of professional skills, including project\nmanagement, interpersonal relationship building and time management, applied in\ncontext;\n5. Communicate insights obtained from applied research using appropriate written\nand oral formats.\nThe Internship Project\nWe expect that the opportunity to complete an internship project will help students\nto bridge study and the world of work, giving them the chance to take on graduate\nlevel responsibility. It will enable them to apply their theoretical knowledge to an\nindustry-based problem whilst gaining professional experience and developing their\nemployability skills to secure their first job when they graduate.\nIn this internship consulting project, students will analyse an issue or problem and\nprovide consultancy type advice and recommendations to an organisation project\nsponsor. The role of the student is to act as a consultant, offering the organisation\nrelevant recommendations on how to address their requirements.\nBenefits\nIn addition to the student, each internship involves:\n\u2022 An organisation, which provides a project and internal Company Supervisor;\n\u2022 An Academic Supervisor;\n\u2022 The Employer Liaison Manager;\n\u2022 Other staff based in the Business School, including librarians and the Business\nCommunication team.\nThe focus of this consultancy project course is to develop several essential skills which\nwill be directly relevant for students\u2019 careers as consultants, managers or analysts,\nincluding developing a critical understanding of New Zealand\u2019s place in international\nmarkets and the successful management of businesses across national and cultural\nborders. Students get the opportunity to conduct internal and external environmental\nanalyses relevant to international business development and to engage in reflective\nand creative thinking and problem-solving to produce a consultancy report with real\nmarket relevance for a New Zealand company.\n\n\fContent Outline\nEach internship involves activities in Q4 2015 and Q1 2016.\nInternship Placement\nThe Internship Process\nStudents are expected to provide an updated CV and LinkedIn profile by the middle\nof Q4 in order for the matching of projects to students. The matching process will\ninvolve meeting the sponsor organisations either in person or virtually if they are\nbased overseas. Once the company and students have met and informed the\nAcademic Supervisor of their preferences, they are then matched and the project\nscope finalised with the Academic Supervisor, so that the project details can be\nconfirmed before the start of Q1. The term is divided into three parts:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nWeeks 1\u20133, when students are based at the University doing background\ninformation searches and preparing for the fieldwork phase;\nWeeks 4\u20138 are the weeks in the field, collecting and analysing data;\nWeeks 9\u201310, when the students return to the University to complete their final\nreport and oral presentation preparations.\n\nAll students will be supervised by an Academic Supervisor and other programme\nfaculty will provide support where expert specific input is needed. Every effort will be\nmade to match students where there is a skills match, therefore students need to be\nof an adequate standard (e.g. demonstrate proficiency in oral and written skills) to\nbe selected for an internship project.\nThe Internship Project Weekly Schedule\nAll interns have a Academic Supervisor. The individual supervisory appointments will\nbe held weekly, will be assigned in week one and are mandatory. Students are\nexpected to attend classes, workshops and one-to-one supervision sessions\nthroughout the course.\nWeeks 1\u20133 of Q1 will involve desk-based research on the organisation and the\nindustry in which it is based, which will be summarised in an interim report that will\nbe submitted for review. During this period, students will also design their data\ncollection tools, pilot them in the first week of the fieldwork stage, and then submit\ntheir revised Project Plan (at the end of Week 4).\nDuring Weeks 4\u20138, the students will execute their Project Plan, spending three days\neach week in their organisation and two days at the University reviewing their\nprogress and attending classes and one-to-one supervisory meetings. As part of this\nprocess, students will have weekly writing tasks so that progress can be tracked and\nstudents can check they are within scope and demonstrating sufficient analysis and\ncritique in their work.\n\n\fThe students will have a Project Plan which they will prepare before entering the field\nand use to check their progress with their Academic Supervisor in the weekly review\nmeetings. Students will use this feedback to inform their Company Supervisors in the\nweekly 15-minute \u2018touch base\u2019 meetings on their first day back in the office each\nweek, during Weeks 4-8 when in the field. The Company Supervisor will review the\nfeedback from the Academic Supervisor from the week before in order to review\nprogress and modify the forthcoming weekly Project Plan if needed.\nAs part of this weekly review session also, with the Company Supervisor, the\nstudent\u2019s professional skills will be assessed on: These will include constructive\nfeedback on:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\ntheir communication skills\ntheir level of engagement\ntheir ability to grasp the organisational context\n\nThis feedback will be used to inform the Company Supervisor\u2019s evaluation (Weeks 4\u2013\n8) and the student\u2019s own reflective essay (500\u2013800 words). In addition, students\nshould keep a log whilst in the field to help inform their various assessments.\nThe Written Report\nAfter spending five weeks working with an organisation, students are required to\nsubmit a written report about their findings. The consultancy project report is\n6,000\u20137,500 words (roughly 16\u201320 pages) including references but excluding\nappendices.\nThe report structure comprises:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nExecutive summary,\nIntroduction\nBackground frameworks, literature review and case analysis\nMethodology\nKey findings and discussion\nRecommendations\nConclusions\nAppendices\n\nIt is essential to present an error-free report, hence, you must submit drafts to the\nBusiness Communication team for regular feedback. The final report needs to be\nsubmitted to the Academic Supervisor prior to the oral presentation.\nFindings from the report will be presented in an oral presentation to the sponsor\norganisation at the Business School. This is an opportunity for students to rehearse\ntheir findings and recommendations and receive feedback that can be used to inform\nthe final report. The final report will be submitted for assessment and then sent on\nto the organisation.\n\n\fFurther details on these assessments will be provided in class and available on the\ncourse webpages on CANVAS.\nLearning and Teaching\nAll students are expected to attend weekly supervision sessions, workshops and\ncontribute to class discussions. Each week you will also meet with the Academic\nand Business Communications Skills Team.\nSupervision Meeting Preparations\nStudents are expected to attend weekly one-to-one supervision meetings. Students\nare expected to submit their weekly contribution to their project report in advance\nof their allocated meeting time. The weekly time slots will be allocated in Week 1.\nThese meetings are mandatory.\nIt is important that all students keep a log of their experience throughout the\ninternship, capturing thoughts about the skills that they have developed during the\nplacement and how they can be conveyed to future graduate recruiters when making\napplications. Students should write down some examples of how they have used skills\nsuch as presenting, leading, organising, problem solving or communication and\nintercultural awareness during the placement whilst they are still fresh in their\nmemory. Keeping a log of this information will be useful when applying for future\nroles, as applicants are often required to complete competency based questions on\napplication forms and at interviews. The log will help students to write their reflective\nessay and final report. Students should use their log to inform their preparation for\ntheir weekly meetings.\nTeaching Staff\nDr Bridgette Sullivan-Taylor\nSenior Lecturer in Strategy and International Business\nCourse Co-Ordinator and Academic Supervisor\nLearning Resources\nAll course material (including slides, cases, articles and questions) will be provided\non the BUSINT 704 Course Page which can be accessed via CANVAS. You should\naccess CANVAS to view announcements, your coursework marks, and download\ninstructional/revision materials.\n\n\fAssessment\nThe course assessment involves six different tasks as detailed in the table below.\nThe assessment structure will be explained in detail in Week 1.\nCoursework Assignment Submission\nTask\nAnnotated\nBibliography:\n\nActivity\nInvolves collation of the relevant business\nframeworks to inform your project topic.

It is designed\nto be highly interactive and utilises a combination of learning experiences, in particular,\ncase studies, peer review and small groups.\nEthics play a significant role in the course, particularly because much of the experiential\nlearning takes place in small groups which, by its very nature, is confidential at both a\npersonal and organisational level. It is expected that all students will respect the\nboundaries of fellow students and act appropriately.\nThe recommended readings are essential because they form an integral part of the\nmethodology. It is expected that all students will have read the designated materials and\ncome prepared to discuss and debate their own observations and thoughts.\nStudents are expected to draw on their own personal learning and experiences from both\nwork and other environments.\n\nTeaching Staff\nChris Johnson, FCIPD, APECS\nAdjunct Professor & Director\nOffice: 0275436311\nEmail: chris.johnson@auckland.ac.nz\n\nDigby Scott\nMobile: 021-224-1478\nEmail: digby@dibyscott.com\n\nGus McIntosh, BSc.,\nBA(Hons), Reg.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\n\fHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs.\nReferen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\nINCLUSIVE LEARNING\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face- to-face\nand/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK\nFormative feedback surveys\nDuring the early part of the quarter (usually Week 3 or 4), short feedback surveys are\nadministered to all students to get a snapshot of how they are coping with their new\ncourses. This qualitative data, which is administered, collected and collated by the\nProgramme Office, is designed as an \u2018early warning\u2019 system of any significant issues with\nthe course that might need addressing quickly.\nLecturers are asked to provide a brief report to the Director GSM MBA on key items\nidentified and proposed actions. Lecturers are also asked to provide a verbal report to the\nclass, proposing any solutions as appropriate.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nThe University of Auckland evaluates the quality of teaching and of courses by using the\nSummative Evaluation Tool, or SET. Summative evaluation is formal, summative\nevaluation of teaching undertaken according to University policy and is conducted at the\nend of a semester/quarter through the use of the formal University SET\ninstruments. Summative evaluation is used by teachers to reflect on their teaching\npractice, and is also used by the University for quality assurance of teaching and courses..\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MKTG305.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nMKTG 305: SERVICES MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\n\nCourse Prescription\nThe marketing and management issues faced by organizations competing in the service\nsector or other firms developing service as a source of competitive advantage.

The purpose of lectures is to explain\nmarketing concepts, to describe how they are used in organizations, and to\nprovide opportunities for students to apply this knowledge to business\nsituations. As it is impossible to fully discuss all the aspects of a given topic\nwithin the lecture time provided, students are required to read the relevant\nchapters from the prescribed textbook prior to attending each lecture. It is\nimportant that students taking this course are able to attend the Term Test\nwhich will be held in Week 5 during the Friday lecture time.\nTutorials\nThere are no scheduled tutorials for this paper. Regular office hours (times\nand locations announced in lectures and via Canvas) will be held to assist\nwith learning and review.\nTeaching Staff\nCourse Convener & Lecturer\nDr. Rebecca Dolan\nrebecca.dolan@auckland.ac.nz\n260-410, Level 4, OGGB\nPh: 9236984\nLecturer\nDr. Sandra D.

Marketing 12/e.\nNew York, NY: McGraw-Hill/Irwin.\nThe textbook is accompanied by an online package, \u2018Connect\u2019 that allows you to\naccess additional online review materials such as quizzes. A registration code\nfor Connect accompanies new textbooks purchased from the University\nBookstore. If you purchase a used textbook, you will need to purchase a new\ncode in order to use the Connect package. Students without a text book can\nchoose to purchase access to both Connect and the eBook at the same site.\nHowever, please note that you will not require the online package to complete\nrequired marked assessments. This course is designed to encourage\nparticipation and active learning. To ensure this outcome, you are expected\nto read the relevant chapters of the required text prior to lectures. Any\nsupplementary resources will be provided via the course library page.\nLecture Recordings\nWe will do our best to record lectures each week and these recordings will be\nuploaded onto Canvas as soon as we receive the Link from ITS. However,\nsometimes, lecture recordings can and do fail. Recordings should not be\nviewed as an alternative to attending lectures. This is not a distance-learning\npaper; i.e. lecture recordings are provided as a revision aid only. If you miss\nclass expecting to rely on a lecture recording, and the lecture recording fails,\nit will be your responsibility to catch up on what you missed. Please note that\nwe cannot guarantee that the Friday afternoon lecture recording will be posted\nprior to the following Monday.\nCourse Library Page\nIn addition to the textbook readings, extra resources may be made\navailable via the course library page.\nCanvas\nCanvas will be used to send students important emails and enable them to\nview course marks etc. Additional useful material may be posted on Canvas\nfrom time to time. Students should check their Canvas email account at least\nevery Monday and Thursday. The home page of this paper on Canvas gives\nstudents access to lecture recordings, lecture slides in outline form, revision\nmaterials such as quizzes, and other useful materials that will be made\navailable as the need arises.\n3\n\n\fOther Resources\nThe library holds a number of marketing textbooks and business journals that\nmay help students in their studies. Magazines, such as Marketing Magazine,\nwill also provide you with relevant up-to-date New Zealand examples of\nmarketing practice.\nAssessment\nAssessment will consist of TEN (10) MCQ quizzes, a ONE one-hour term\ntest (to be held in week 5 during the Friday lecture), ONE two-part Aropa\npeer-evaluation assignment (due in week 9 and 10), and a final two-hour\nexam (refer to Student Services Online for the exam schedule).

A list of lecture topics and a tentative course\nschedule is provided at the end of this course outline. As it is impossible to\nfully discuss all the aspects of a given topic within the lecture time provided,\nstudents are required to read the relevant chapters from the prescribed\ntextbook prior to attending the lecture. Interactive discussions will be used\nto apply course material to practical marketing situations. Examples very\nsimilar to those discussed in lectures will be included in the tests and the final\nexam.\nStudents who regularly attend lectures will have a greater\nunderstanding of how to tackle such questions in a test and examination\ncontext. Students will also sometimes be asked to form pairs or small groups\nin order to better engage in the interactive learning experience. Lectures may\ninclude videos and other materials that will be relevant to the assessment in\nthe course.\nLecture recordings\nWhen traditional lectures are given, we will do our best to ensure that they\nare recorded and made available via the course homepage on Canvas as\nsoon as possible after the lecture. However, students are cautioned that:\n\u2022 Lecture recordings are not meant to be a substitute for attending\nlectures and students who miss lectures will find themselves at a\ndisadvantage in tests and exams;\n\u2022 Some lecture content may not be captured by the recordings e.g.\nstudent comments or a copyrighted video recording;\n\u2022 Technology is fallible (i.e. it can FAIL), and we are not responsible,\nshould you miss lectures expecting to rely on a recording, and find\nthat a recording is damaged/not complete/not audible/not available;\n\u2022 It is possible that we may have one or more guest lecturers who may\nnot agree to their lecture being recorded;\n\u2022 Lecture recordings are for your individual use related to your\nenrolment in this paper only. This means two things: a) people that\nare not currently enrolled in the course are not permitted to access\nand/or use the recordings; and b) you cannot use the recordings for\npurposes not related to this paper;\n\u2022 The lecturer delivering a particular lecture retains the intellectual\nproperty rights to the material recorded. Therefore, you cannot make\nadditional copies of recordings to sell or give to other people and, if\nyou include information from a lecture recording in something you\nwrite (for purposes other than the tests and exam in this paper), you\nmust reference it appropriately, to avoid being charged with\nplagiarism. For example, \u201cDolan, R. (2017), Lecture Recording for\nMKTG 201, Week 1, accessed on 20.04.17\u201d.\n5\n\n\f\u2022\n\nIn line with department policy, lecture recordings will be streamed\nonly and will not be downloadable; i.e. you can view them online but\nwill not be able to download them onto your computer. If you do not\nhave broadband access at home, you will have to view the recordings\non campus.\n\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss (privately) any impairment-related\nrequirements face-to-face and/or in written form with the course convener.\nStudent Feedback\nCourse representatives are selected from the enrolled students to help solicit\nfeedback from the class at least once during the semester. Wherever\npossible, this feedback is used to shape or change the course to better meet\nstudents\u2019 needs. For example, previous students have indicated that they\nfind copies of power point slides useful, and so the lecturers now make\npartially complete slides available before each lecture. Students are also\ngiven the opportunity to provide feedback via formal evaluations at the end\nof the semester. This feedback is used (where possible) to improve the course\nin subsequent semesters.\nExpectations Regarding Classroom Behaviour\nPlease turn your cell phone OFF or to SILENT mode before your lecture\ncommences. In order to provide a good learning environment for all students,\ncell phone ringing, texting, or excessive personal chatter during scheduled\nclass meetings is considered unacceptable and may cause you to be ejected\nfrom lectures and/or tests. Students are expected to express themselves\npolitely to one another and to the teaching team or guest speakers. Although\nyou are welcome to bring drinking water to lectures, please be advised that\nUniversity Lecture Theatre Management policy does not permit food or\nbeverages to be consumed in lecture theatres or computer labs. Please try\nto arrive at your lecture theatre before the scheduled class commences, and\nif you are unavoidably late or have to leave early, please try to minimise the\ndisruption to the class.\nCommunicating with the 201 Teaching Team\nThe MKTG 201 Teaching Team consists of your Course Convener and Lecturer\nDr. Rebecca Dolan, Lecturer Dr. Sandra Smith, Professional Teaching Fellow\nMargot Bowker, and the Marketing Department Undergraduate Course\nAdministrator, Ms. Christina Huang. Teaching team office hours will be\nannounced in the first lecture.\nPlease note:\n1. Outside of scheduled office hours, the BEST way to contact the\nmembers of the MKTG 201 Teaching Team is via the discussion forums\non Canvas. We will check the discussions often, and get back to you as\nsoon as possible.\n6\n\n\f2. If you need to contact us about an issue that is best communicated by\nemail. In general, queries regarding material covered in lectures should\nbe directed to the lecturer who delivered that particular lecture.\nAdministrative queries (e.g. missed test, enrolment issues etc) should\nbe directed to the undergraduate course administrator, Ms. Christina\nHuang. If in doubt as to who to send your email to, please send it to\nthe\ncourse\nconvener,\nDr.\nRebecca\nDolan\n(rebecca.dolan@auckland.ac.nz), and she will forward it to the correct\nperson if required. Please do not email-bomb us, i.e. send the same\nemail to every person on the team at once, as this practice may result\nin a delayed reply while we try to ascertain who should reply to your\nquery.\nMORE INFORMATION ON ASSESSMENT\nOnline Quizzes (10%)\nThere will be ten (10) online quizzes to be held in weeks 1-4, 6-11.\nThe quizzes are designed to test your understanding of the relevant reading\nfrom each week. Each quiz contains ten (10) multiple choice questions and\neach of the ten quizzes is worth 1% (total 10%).\nEach week\u2019s assigned reading (text book chapter/s) should be completed prior\nto attending the lecture. As such, the deadline for each quiz is 10am,\nThursday, of the relevant week. I.e. Week 3 Quiz deadline is 10am, Thursday,\nWeek 3.\nWe understand that in the first week of the semester there may be late\nenrollments, so we have allowed until Thursday 10am of Week 3 (10th of\nAugust) for the first TWO quizzes to be completed. From Week 3 onwards,\neach quiz will need to be completed within the assigned week. Specific\nguidelines and instructions will be posted on Canvas and discussed in the\nlectures.\nAropa Peer Evaluation Assignment (10%)\nThe peer evaluation assignment will be conducted via Aropa and contains\ntwo components:\nPart A (5%): A 400-500 word written submission\nDeadline: Sunday 8th October 11.59PM\nPart B (5%): Two (2) peer evaluations of Part A\nDeadline: Sunday 15th October 11.59PM\nSpecific guidelines, instructions, and examples will be posted on Canvas and\ndiscussed in the lectures.\n\n7\n\n\fTerm Test\nThere will be one term test worth 20%. The test will consist of one\ncompulsory long-answer question, and two short answer questions. The term\ntest will be held in Week 5 during the Friday lecture time. If you miss the\nterm test for an approved, documented reason (e.g. illness documented with\nmedical certificate) you will need to apply for an \u2018aegrotat and compassionate\nconsideration\u2019 (refer to https://www.auckland.ac.nz /en/for /currentstudents/cs-academic-information/cs-examination-information/cs-aegrotatand-compassionate-consideration.html\nin particular refer to the section dealing with written tests). The term test will\nassess your learning from Weeks 1-4.\nFinal exam\nThe final two-hour exam is worth 60% of your final mark and will consist of\nessay questions. The exam will test your understanding of marketing\nconcepts and theories in an integrated manner. You will also be required to\ndemonstrate the application of these concepts and theories in business\npractice. More details of the final exam, will be provided in lectures and on\nCanvas.\nMARKETING MANAGEMENT 201 \u2013 TENTATIVE* LECTURE\nPROGRAMME\n(*all information is tentative and changes may be announced in lectures and\non Canvas)\nW\nK\n\nDates\n\n1\n\n27 &\n28 July\n\n2\n\n3&4\nAug\n10 &\n11 Aug\n17 &\n18 Aug\n24 &\n25 Aug\n31 Aug\n&1\nSep\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n21, 22\nSept\n\nFriday 2-4pm Reading\n(text\nOGGB 260book)\n092\nIntroduction to Ch 1\nMarketing and\nCh 4\nMarketing\nEthics\nStrategic\nStrategic\nCh 2\nMarketing\nMarketing\nMarketing\nMarketing\nCh 8\nResearch\nResearch\nBuyer\nBuyer\nCh 5\nBehaviour\nBehaviour\nNo lecture\nTerm Test\n(20%)\nSegmentation, International\nCh 9\nTargeting &\nMarketing\nCh 7\nPositioning\nMid-Semester Break\nProduct I\nProduct I\nCh 10\nThursday\n10-11am\nENG 1439\nCourse\nOverview\n\n8\n\nAssessment\nMCQ Week 1\nQuiz (1%)\nMCQ Week 2\nQuiz (1%)\nMCQ Week 3\nQuiz (1%)\nMCQ Week 4\nQuiz (1%)\nTerm Test\n(20%)\nMCQ Week 6\nQuiz (1%)\n\nMCQ Week 7\nQuiz (1%)\n\n\f8\n\n28, 29\nSept\n5,6 Oct\n\nProduct II\nBranding\nPricing\n\nProduct II\nServices\nPricing\n\nCh\nCh\nCh\nCh\n\n10\n\n12, 13\nOct\n\nDistribution\n\nDistribution\n\nCh 15\nCh 16\n\n11\n\n19,20\nOct\n\nPromotion I\n\nPromotion I\n\n12\n\n26, 27\nOct\n\nPromotion II\n\nCourse\nSummary\n\nCh 17\nCh 18\nCh 20\nCh. 21\n\n9\n\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\nMCQ Week 8\nQuiz (1%)\nMCQ Week 9\nQuiz (1%)\nAropa Part A\ndue 8th Oct\nMCQ Week 10\nQuiz (1%)\nAropa Part B\ndue 15th Oct.\nMCQ Week 11\nQuiz (1%)\n\nMessage from Student Advice and Advocacy Services\nThe University understands that unfortunately, life and studies sometimes do\nnot run as smoothly as you hope.

This is why we have written this protocol which describes the key\npolicies and practices that will help you to have a clear understanding of what\nyou can expect from your lecturer and what the lecturer can expect from you.\nIn respect to this, our overriding principles are consistency and fairness in\nterms of how each student is treated.\nCommunication\nCourse-Coordinators, Lecturers and Graduate Teaching Assistants will always\naim to communicate with you in a timely and efficient manner. The main\navenue for providing course information is via lectures. Additionally, the main\ninformation related to the course, such as deadlines for your assignments,\ncan be found in the Course Outline. Some Course Outlines are provided\nelectronically via Canvas.\nWe also use Canvas software to help students keep track of their own\nprogress, e.g. allowing students to check their own marks on the web. Some\nmarketing lecturers may also use Canvas software to:\n\u25baProvide students with unrestricted access to course materials (lecture\nnotes, case studies and reference materials). Students will be able to access\nthese materials anytime and anywhere via the Internet.\n\u25baKeep students informed with changes to the schedule, upcoming events,\nand opportunities for part time marketing jobs or social events.\nPlease note that the information posted on Canvas does not fully cover\ninformation given in lectures. Therefore, if you miss a class, you should ask\nother students whether you have missed any important announcements (or\nmaterials). It is your responsibility to monitor, read, and keep up to date on\nall course communications.\nThe email address listed in Canvas is the address to which your course\nlecturers will send any important messages and updates. Your current mailing\naddress and other contact details must always be kept up to date on Student\nServices Online, the University\u2019s online enrolment and student administration\nsystem. You can update your personal details by logging on to Student\nServices Online and then clicking on \u201cUpdate your details\u201d.\n\n10\n\n\fGrading of Assessments\nStudents can expect all mid-semester tests and assignments (in courses\nwhere these are included) to be graded and returned within two to three\nweeks (unless otherwise specified by the lecturer). Your grades will be\nviewable on Canvas as soon as they are available. Always remember to\ncompare your grades on Canvas with the grades that are written on your test\nor assignments, and report any discrepancies to your lecturer or tutor (if\napplicable) without delay.\nGrading Scale\nThis is the scale use to undergraduate tests and assignments for\nUndergraduate courses in the Department of Marketing:\nGRAD DESCRIPTION\nE\nA+\nOutstanding\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\n\n%\n90100\n85-89\n80-84\n75-79\n70-74\n65-69\n60-64\n\nExcellent\nApproaching Excellence\nVery good, comfortably meeting expectations\nGood, meets expectations\nGood, just meets expectations but minor problems\nAdequate, almost meeting expectations but minor\nproblems\nC\nAdequate, not quite meeting expectations because of\n55-59\nproblems\nCJust adequate, not quite meeting expectations because\n50-54\nof further problems\nD+\nInadequate, further problems and below expectations\n45-49\nD\nInadequate, well below expectations because of major\n40-44\nproblems\nDCompletely inadequate, well below expectations\n0-39\nbecause of major problems\nPlease note: The grade ranges are indicative only. Scaling may be applied.\nAssignments (applicable only to courses with assignments)\nPlease note that group and individual assignment weightings (in courses\nwhere assignments are included) can NOT be transferred to the final\nexam/assessment.\nWhen handing in your assignments, please use the appropriate cover sheet,\nand please use your official name, as is currently used in University records.\nYou will have considerable advance notice about the date that assignments\nare due. Therefore, you must plan your work to give yourself leeway so\nunforeseen events such as computer problems or losing an assignment do not\nprevent you from handing the assignment in on time. Unacceptable reasons\nfor a late assignment also include being overseas or other work or sporting\ncommitments. Acceptable reasons for handing a late assignment might be a\n11\n\n\flonger period of illness prior to the deadline, unexpected incarceration or\nbereavement. However, in these circumstances you will be required to provide\nsuitable documentation as evidence (e.g. a certificate from the campus Health\nCentre), as early as possible, but no later than the assignment due date.\nStudents will be penalised for handing in assignments after the due date.\nBelow is a list of penalties that can be expected:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nday late 10% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 20% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 30% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 40% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 50% off grade achieved by student\n\nNote: Assignments handed in five minutes past the deadline are considered\none day late. If an assignment is due in on a Friday, then an assignment\nsubmitted on Monday is considered to be three days late. Assignments\nhanded in later than five days after the deadline will not be graded. Although\nthese penalties may seem harsh, their purpose is to prepare you for the\nexpectations your employer will have of you (i.e. planning your time\nefficiently, and meeting deadlines) while maintaining fair and equitable\ntreatment of all students.\nFor group assignments, all members of the group will be awarded the same\ngroup assignment mark, unless the course coordinator is informed of group\nissues that may have adversely affected the group work. Such issues must\nbe brought to the attention of the course co-ordinator before the assignment\ndue date.\nIn group assignments where peer assessment is used, students not\ncontributing equally to the group effort may be penalised. Therefore, students\nshould inform their team mates, and the teaching staff, if they are unable to\ncontribute equitably to the group assignment at any point. Once again,\nsuitable documentation must be given to the course co-ordinator as early as\npossible, but no later than the assignment due date.\nImportance of Term Test and the Final Exam\nTerm tests provide an opportunity for students to test their individual\nknowledge under controlled conditions, and also allow students to practice for\nthe final exam. The final exam is an integral part of each paper and accounts\nfor a large percentage of your final grade. Failing the final exam may make it\nvery difficult to pass a paper.\nIt is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of the location, time, and date of\ntheir semester tests and final exams. Students who miss tests or final exams\nbecause of ill health or bereavement reasons may apply for an aegrotat or for\ncompassionate consideration (see the University Calendar/Examination\nRegulations for the relevant procedures). Be aware that you have to apply\n12\n\n\fwithin 7 days after the test/exam.\nNote: Acceptable reasons for missing tests/exams include documented illness\nof yourself or your dependent(s), incarceration and bereavement. Reasons\nsuch as going on vacation, sporting or work commitments, or getting the date\nand/or time of test wrong etc. are not acceptable. If you are disabled or have\nother difficulties necessitating special accommodation for the test/exam (e.g.\na longer test time, or a separate testing room), please advise the Course\nCoordinator as soon as possible.\nClass Representatives\nThe Marketing Department values the role of class representatives and\nencourages students to act in this capacity. Students are encouraged to talk\nto class representatives about the course. Lecturers really appreciate the class\nrepresentatives\u2019 feedback. This channel is used as an opportunity to make\nimprovements to the course. There are two formal class representative\nmeetings during a semester. During these meetings, class representatives\nhave the opportunity to talk to the lecturers and the undergraduate coordinator about the overall evaluation of the course, and provide ideas and\nsuggestions.\nDisputes\nIf you have a problem with any Marketing course, first approach your lecturer\nor course co-ordinator. If you are uncomfortable approaching your course\nco-ordinator then please contact one of the Marketing Department\u2019s\nundergraduate co-ordinators:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nDr. Catherine Frethey-Bentham (OGGB, 260-414, phone: 373 7599\nExt. 88830,\ne-mail: c.bentham@auckland.ac.nz)\nDr. Rebecca Dolan (OGGB, 260-410, phone: 9236984, e-mail:\nrebecca.dolan@auckland.ac.nz)\n\nStudents who wish to query their final exam and/or final grade must do so\nthrough the appropriate channels (for the procedure see the University\nCalendar/Examination Regulations). You can apply only for a recount (not a\nremark) of your exam. Please do not contact your lecturers directly because\nthey will not be able to give out any information on final exam marks.\nCOPYRIGHT WARNING NOTICE\nThe material for this course is protected by copyright and has been copied by\nand solely for the educational purposes of the University under licence.

In coursework assignments submitted for\nmarking, plagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without\nexplicit acknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources,\nincluding books, journal articles, the internet, and other students\u2019\nassignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be reviewed against electronic\nsource material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable\nrequest, students may be required to provide an electronic version of their\nwork for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are\nin doubt about how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers,\ntutors and the Student Learning Centre are good places to start. Please refer\nto the following website for further information about academic referencing:\nwww.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on\nhow to avoid plagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckla444nd.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the\nmarks for the assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s\nDiscipline Committee, where further penalties can be imposed.\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are\npermitted to seek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are\nimportant limits on the amount and type of assistance that can be given to\nyou in completing your assignments, including group work.

Evaluates the design, management,\nand improvement of operations in goods and services organisations and critiques\nstrategies to improve global supply chain performance.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\nPrerequisite: 60 points from BUSMGT 711-714 with at least a B- average\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nOperations Management deals with the processes through which organisations create and\ndistribute products and services (outputs), utilising resources including labour, materials,\nequipment, capital, information, and technology (inputs). These processes must be\ndesigned, controlled, and improved to meet a variety of performance objectives, taking\ninto account constraints and uncertainty in the internal and external environment.\nThe goals of the course are for students to be able to:\n\uf0b7 understand and analyse the role of operations and supply chain management \u2013 in both\ndomestic and global (international and cross-border) contexts;\n\uf0b7 understand key trade-offs involved in operations and supply chain management and\nhow they relate to an organisation\u2019s strategy and competitive position; and\n\uf0b7 utilise key concepts, models, and tools to formulate and justify recommendations to\nimprove operations and supply chain processes.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. explain the key concepts of operations strategy and justify how operations and supply\nchain management can be used to improve the competitive position of manufacturing\nand service organisations;\n2. identify and analyse methods to match capacity and demand of products and services\nto improve performance - particularly in the face of uncertainty;\n3. generate and critique methods and implementation of quality management and\nprocess improvement - using concepts such as lean thinking and six sigma;\n4. identify supply chain and inventory management issues and provide conceptual\n(methods and ideas) and analytical (modelling) approaches to deal with them\neffectively (e.g., reducing working capital requirements and/or improving customer\nservice);\n5. through independent research, articulate important linkages between operations and\nsupply chain management and other areas of the firm: in particular human resources,\nmarketing, and finance.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\nContent Outline\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nIntroduction, Frameworks and Operations Strategy\nOperations Strategy\nQuality Management\nProcess Management\nLean Operations and Just-in-Time\nCapacity and Constraint Management\nDemand Management and Inventory Management\nInventory Management\nSupply Chain Management\nSupply Chain Management and Course Review\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nThe course will show how operations in manufacturing and services should establish\nstrategy and manage resources and processes along with supply chain interactions. By\nutilising frameworks and tools and thinking critically and creatively, operations can solve\npractical problems and generate innovative ideas to establish valuable organizational\ncapabilities (including those providing sustainable competitive advantage) that are aligned\nwith business strategy, and integrated with marketing, people, information systems, and\nfinance.\nA variety of instructional methods will be employed, including lecture, case discussion,\nworked examples, simulations, and video (some for a \u201cflipped classroom\u201d). The course\ncontent presents both practice (from case studies and class examples) and contemporary\nresearch (primarily from journal articles) in Operations Management and closely-related\nfields. Five cases in the course represent a variety of industries and geographical focus.\nThe class will meet from 2:30-4:30pm on Wednesday afternoons for a plenary session in\nCase Room 1 (260-005), and from 9:00-11:00am on Friday mornings for a TBL/tutorial\nsession in 260-215. Recordings of all sessions (except for case studies and simulation\nfeedback) will be provided.\nPreparation\nStudents should be prepared to spend around seven hours per week on activities related\nto this course. These activities include carrying out the required readings and assignments,\nengaging with about 7 hours of video material (of content and worked examples in a\n\u201ctutorial\u201d format), working through numerous examples (most from previous tests and\nassignments), participating in the simulations, and preparing for the test.\nIt is essential to have read and reflected on the prescribed material before each session\nto ensure class discussion is well informed and productive. The time between the end of\nclass on Wednesday afternoon and the start of class on Friday morning each week is\nparticularly important to cover the worked examples (written and video format), on\nCANVAS (including video material). For cases, you should also make notes on your\nanswers to the questions provided on CANVAS.\nFeedback \u2013 both ways\nI endeavour to provide feedback on all submissions/tests within one week at the most.\nThis feedback should prove helpful for subsequent assessment. I am happy to correspond\nvia e-mail, phone, skype or in person.\nStudent feedback will be sought throughout the course \u2013 informally, via evaluation, and\nstudent representatives. I also welcome questions you may have after any session. Where\nappropriate I will answer these for the whole class in a subsequent session, and the best\nones will be recognized as a contribution to the class discussion. I welcome contributions\n\n2\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\u2013 questions, comments, critique, etc. \u2013 to the class discussion, and encourage e-mailing\nme to help with your learning experience.\nI encourage you to make use of my office hours \u2013 concerning questions about the course\nmaterial at any level (whether you\u2019re struggling, want feedback on your learning, or want\nto be extended). To make things easier you might like to bring (or email me) a question\nto start the conversation, or something in your experience that pertains to the course.\n\nTeaching Staff\nDavid Robb\nTitle:\nPhone:\nOffice:\nOffice Hours:\nEmail:\n\nProfessor of Operations and Supply Chain Management\n09-923-2812\nMobile:\n021-238-2728\n260-346 (overlooks Grafton Road)\nWednesday 10am-12noon in 260-346\nd.robb@auckland.ac.nz\nSkype: davidjrobb\nWechat: davidrobb\n\nShandong Mou\nTitle:\nGraduate Teaching Assistant\nOffice Hours: Friday, 11am-12noon in 260-349\nEmail:\ns.mou@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\n\nThe following text is optional: Cachon, G., and Terwiesch, C.

To be submitted on\nCANVAS. Your report must state on the cover what contribution each team member made.\nIn your name appearing on the cover, you are acknowledging that you have contributed\napproximately equally to the report. The specification, questions, and grading rubric are\non CANVAS.\nIndividual Assignment (25%)\nThis provides a setting for testing your understanding of course content with respect to a\nspecific business decision. The specifications, questions, and the grading sheet are on\nCANVAS.\nGroup Simulation (12.5%)\nThe Littlefield Labs simulation will be run on Friday morning of Week 8. In the days\nbeforehand your group should meet to discuss your strategy. Further details will be\nprovided on CANVAS. Your grade will be comprised of two portions: (i) a document\nanswering some questions about your team\u2019s plan/strategy (to be submitted on CANVAS\nbefore the simulation runs) [5%], and your team\u2019s final cash position [7.5%] (The top\nperforming group will receive 100% for the second component, with the marks for the\nother groups a linear function of the highest cash position).\nFinal test (50%)\nThe final test is a 2 hour open book test at the end of Week 10. It will cover material\nthroughout the course, and include application and integration of concepts, and provide\nan opportunity to demonstrate your ability to think strategically and creatively under\npressure, and as such will reward thoughtful reading, and ability to see connections\nbetween content areas, especially with operations strategy. You may bring your notes,\ndocuments posted on CANVAS, and the textbook (annotations allowed). You should bring\na calculator (but it may not have text storage capability). Examinable material includes all\nmaterial covered in class (including cases), along with assigned readings, cases, and\ncoursework. No devices capable of any form of communication (this includes cell phones)\nare permitted in the tests.\nThe venue for the tests will be confirmed in class time and posted on CANVAS. Where\nnecessary, students should discuss with the Programme Office Student Advisors. An\n\n4\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\napplication for medical or compassionate consideration should be made to Registry\n(through Student Health or Counselling Services) within one week of the test.\nA mock test will be available in Week 6. It is imperative that you attempt the test questions\nprior to seeing the model answers/commentary I will provide closer to the test date.\nAssignment Submission\nAll assignments are to be submitted via CANVAS in Word or pdf format. No hard copy is\nrequired. For the group reports, the nominated leader should submit the assignment on\nCANVAS by the due date. Full names and University ID number must be clearly displayed\non all submissions. Late assignments will receive a 5% (absolute) reduction in grade per\nday (full or part), until the class in which the assignment/case solutions are discussed\n(when they will receive zero). Note that you have access to Grammarly, and a team of\nspecialist Business Communication Professional Teaching Fellows is available to provide\nformative feedback of assignments submitted no later than 24 hours before the deadline.\nGroup formation\nThe groups for the case study report and simulations should have 4 members, with at\nleast two undergraduate degree faculties (e.g., Business/Commerce, Arts, Science,\nEngineering, Law) and ideally at least two nationalities represented. The nominated leader\nof each group should submit the sign-up sheet in class on Wednesday June 28th, with (i)\nthe group member names, (ii) the group name (this will be used to register you for the\nsimulation). Students not in a group of 4 students by that time will be assigned to a group.\nFor the TBL/tutorial sessions you are advised to sit in your groups, but you may choose to\nmove around.\n\n5\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\nDetailed Course Schedule\n\n\t\n\nDate\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nTopic\n\nRequired Readings, cases, Optional\nand videos1\nreading2\n\nJun 21 Introduction,\nLaseter (2009)\n1.1\nFrameworks, and\nJun 23 Operations Strategy\nJun 28\nPWC (2015)\nOperations Strategy\nJun 30\nCase: Southwest Airlines (2013)\nJacobs and Chase (2013): pp.304Jul 05\n317\nQuality Management\nCase: Chef Davide Oldani and\nJul 07\nRistorante D'O (2013)\n10.1-10.5, 10.9\nJul 12\nV1, V2\nProcess Management\nJul 14\nCase: Noram Foods\nAnon (2015)\n7.1-7.5,\nJul 19 Lean Operations and\nDuncan and Ritter (2014)\n11.1-11.10\nJust-in-Time\nJul 21\nSite visit\n8.1-8.6, 8.11-8.12 (Cachon and\n2.2, 2.3,\nTerwiesch)\n3.1-3.5,\nJul 26 Capacity and\nV3, V4, V5, V6, V7\n9.1\nConstraint\nCase: Goulds Fine Foods\nManagement\nCase: Breakfast at the Paramount\nJul 28\n(2017)\n2.4,2.5\nVideo on Demand Management\n7.6,7.7\nDemand\nand\nAug 02\nV8, V9\n12.1-12.7\nInventory\n14.1-14.10\nManagement\nAug 04\nRobb (2017)\nAug 09 Inventory\nManagement\nAug 11\nLittlefield Labs Simulation\nAug 16\n\n9\n\nSupply Chain\nAug 18 Management\n\nAug 23 Supply Chain\nManagement\n10\nAug 25 Course Review\n\nCase: Zara: The World\u2019s largest\nfashion retailer (2015)\nGuest speaker\ne-beer game instructions (RLT\nversion\n17.1-17.2\n\nAug 25 Final Test (2 hours)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1\n2\n\nMust be read (or watched\u2014Vx are 10 minute videos) prior to the session indicated.\t\nCachon and Terwiesch (2013).

Setting the Reorder Point using Business Intelligence\n\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\n\n7\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\nInclusive Learning\n\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face- to-face\nand/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor\n\nStudent Feedback\nFormative feedback surveys\nDuring the early part of the quarter (usually Week 3 or 4), short feedback surveys are\nadministered to all students to get a snapshot of how they are coping with their new\ncourses. This qualitative data, which is administered, collected and collated by the\nProgramme Office, is designed as an \u2018early warning\u2019 system of any significant issues with\nthe course that might need addressing quickly.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nThe University of Auckland evaluates the quality of teaching and of courses by using the\nthe Summative Evaluation Tool, or SET. Summative evaluation is formal, summative\nevaluation of teaching undertaken according to University policy and is conducted at the\nend of a semester/quarter through the use of the formal University SET instruments.\nSummative evaluation is used by teachers to reflect on their teaching practice, and is also\nused by the University for quality assurance of teaching and courses.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat, and views\ncheating in coursework as a serious academic offence. The work that a student submits for\ngrading must be the student's own work, reflecting his or her learning. Where work from\nother sources is used, it must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This requirement\nalso applies to sources on the world-wide web. A student's assessed work may be reviewed\nagainst electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon\nreasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of their work\nfor computerised review.\n\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\n\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions, the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up-to-date information via Canvas and the university website.\n\n8\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSADMIN798A.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017 BUSADMIN 798 A & B:\nMBA RESEARCH PROJECT (30 POINTS)\nQuarter 2 & 4 (1174 & 1178)\nCourse Prescription\nIndividual project addressing a specific management challenge or business issue facing\nan organisation.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nTo complete this course students must enrol in BUSADMIN 798 A and B, or BUSADMIN 798 .\n\nGoals of the Course\nThis is the capstone course of the MBA.

The objective will be achieved through a defined\nprocess of (usually) sequential steps. Class participants will clarify a personally-relevant\nresearch idea; find, understand and assess prior research related to the topic; evaluate\npotential data sources and acquire usable data; develop an appropriate approach to\nanalysing that data; and write a clear and convincing research report which encapsulates\nthe important elements developed through the research process. Class sessions are\ndesigned to facilitate this research process, and will include interactive lectures, exercises,\npeer review and one-to-one consultation with members of academic staff.\nWeekend streams will meet for six hours each fortnight during Quarters 2 and 4, while\nCohort A07 will usually meet for three hours one evening per week. Class time will be used\nfor a combination of lectures and seminar discussions of individual projects. In addition to\nattending class, students should be prepared to spend about another fourteen hours per\n\n\ffortnight on activities related to this course. In Quarter 2 you will identify your research\ntopic and select a specific issue for further investigation. You will then assess the theories,\nfindings and approaches of other researchers using a range of quality sources.\nThe key output for Quarter 2 will be a summary of background readings concluding with a\nrefinement of your chosen problem. In Quarter 4 you will use your summary of background\nreadings as a starting point and explore your issue further using business data and\ninformation drawn from your research context. You will analyse your data and write a wellargued and evidence-based report that addresses your business problem, draws on the\nresearch of others and your own findings to culminate in a coherent set of conclusions and\nrecommendations.\nThis is a two quarter course [Q2 and Q4], with a single grade reported at the end of Q4.\nThe MBA Breakfast for December 2017 will feature a selection of presentations from both\ncohorts. Presenters will be chosen on criteria including quality of the research, accessibility\nof the topic to a general business audience, and presentation skills.\n\nCohort 07&08 Teaching Staff\n\nCohort 46 Teaching Staff\n\nDr. Benjamin Fath\nLecturer\nGraduate School of Management\nOffice: OGGB 374\nEmail: b.fath@auckland.ac.nz\n\nDr. Elizabeth George\nProfessor\nGraduate School of Management\nOffice: OGGB 344\nTel:\n09 9235310\nEmail: e.george@auckland.ac.nz\nAvailable during class & by appointment\n\nDr. Nina Brosius\nEmail: n.brosius@auckland.ac.nz\nAvailable during class & by appointment\n\nDr. Nina Brosius\nEmail: n.brosius@auckland.ac.nz\nAvailable during class & by appointment\n\nLearning Resources\nA suggested textbook for this course is: Jankowicz, A.D.

More details on each will be provided\nduring the quarter.\nThe first, Problem Description and Summary of Background Readings, gives you an\nopportunity to present the topic you have chosen to research, the nature of the specific\nproblem, and a summary of what has been studied earlier. The aim of this assessment is\nfor you to demonstrate that you have a \u201cresearchable\u201d problem and that you know what\nhas been written about this problem earlier in the academic or managerial literatures. The\nassessment will be up to 3000 word document (approximately 12 pages, double spaced,\n12 point font). This document is due in Week 9 (for the weekly class) and May 26 (for the\nfortnightly class), and will be given to two peers on that day.\nThe second type of assessment, Peer Feedback, gives you an opportunity to read and\ncritique the work of two classmates and give them developmental feedback. The aim of\nthis assessment is for you to develop the skill of identifying the strengths and weaknesses\nof a proposed research project. You will also have to suggest to the authors what they\ncould do to make their problem description or summary of research stronger. Your\nfeedback will be marked by the academic staff for the quality of the feedback and its\u2019\nconstructive tone. You will provide peer feedback to two classmates in Quarter 2 and\nanother two classmates in Quarter 4. Each document of feedback will be approximately\n500 words (approximately 2 pages, double spaced, 12 point font). In Quarter 2, you will\nreceive the report to which you will give your feedback in week 9/May 26. You will have to\nsubmit your peer feedback electronically by the end of the working day (5:00 pm) on June\n9 for both the weekly class and the fortnightly class.\nThe third type of assessment, Project Plan and Final Research Report, gives you the\nopportunity to demonstrate your ability to systematically find answers to the research\nquestion to identified in Quarter 2. This assessment should be informed by the feedback\nthat you will have received in Quarters 2 and 4 from your peers and the academic staff.\nYou assessments will be graded based on the quality of your ideas as well as the manner\nin which you present your work. You can find more information on how we will assess\nyour work in the grading rubrics at the end of this document.\nThe broad relationship between these assessments and the course learning outcomes is as\nfollows:\n\nLearning\nOutcome\n\nProblem\ndescription\n\n1 Problem\n\nSummary\nof\nBackground\nReadings\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n3 Analysis\n4 Decision making\nX\n\nProject\nReport\n\nX\n\nX\n\n2 Literature\n\n5 Communication\n\nPlan\n\nResearch\nPresentation\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\n\n\fPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing:\nwww.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed\n\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the instructor. If you have been granted special examination\nconditions, please make the instructor aware of these at the beginning of the quarter, so\nthat appropriate arrangements can be made.\n\nStudent feedback\nJust as I will be giving you feedback throughout the quarter I will also expect you to give\nme feedback on ways in which I can facilitate the learning environment in the class. I\ncannot promise that I will make all the changes that you might want but I will certainly\nlisten to you and attempt to find a solution that will work for everyone.\nThis course has been offered by the Graduate School of Management previously. In\nresponse to feedback from 2016, we made the following modifications:\n- Peer feedback will now be a formalised part of the learning experience.\n- The word count of the final report is now reduced to accommodate this change.\nStudents will be asked to complete a course evaluation near the end of the course to\nprovide feedback that will be used to inform the ongoing development of the course.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies.

It has two\nbroad objectives. The first objective is to provide students with a basic framework of how to conduct\nresearch in finance and how to avoid some of the pitfalls of research in finance. The second objective\nis to help you in finding a potential topic for your research project and to develop this into a rigorous\nresearch proposal. These objectives are achieved through exposing students to a range of\ncontemporary research issues in finance.\nLearning Outcomes\nAt the successful completion of the course, students should be able to:\n1. Formulate a well-motivated research question.\n2. Develop research hypotheses.\n3. Select appropriate research methods to test hypotheses.\n4. Write a research proposal.\n5. Draw sensible inferences from results.\nIn addition to developing your research skills in finance, Finance 705 aims to develop generic skills\nas required by relevant professional bodies and the University of Auckland Business School (UABS).\nAt the end of the course, you should be able to:\n6. Demonstrate verbal, written, and interpersonal communication skills, at a level where you\ncan communicate knowledge clearly and succinctly.\nLearning Resources\nAll readings and other learning resources can be obtained through the library catalogue,\nscholar.google.com, ssrn.com or electronic databases at UABS.\nLearning and Teaching\nThe course consists of 3-hour lectures and seminars. In the seminars, you will present your research\ntopic, your research proposal, and a pre-assigned topic. Questions are encouraged both during and\nafter lectures and seminars. All students are expected to come to class prepared and willing to\nengage in active discussion. Active class participation is an important part of Finance 705, and\nwill be a component in the calculation of the final mark.\nSince each of us brings different experiences and backgrounds to class, and has different ways of\napproaching the issues we will be addressing in the course, one of the objectives of class\n\n\fparticipation is to learn from one another. You will not be penalised for subscribing to a different\nway of thinking as long as you can logically back up your points. The only \u201cbad\u201d outcome is a\nlack of participation.\nTeaching Staff\nProfessor Henk Berkman\nRoom 577, Owen G.

Students concurrently working on a Research Thesis (i.e. in the same semester) are also\nwelcome, but are expected to develop a new research proposal on a different topic.\n\nPresentations\nEach of you will prepare a short presentation on a potential research topic, you will also do a group\npresentation on an assigned article, and you will each present your research proposal. During and\nfollowing presentations, it is expected that the class will discuss research issues that arise from\nyour presentation. Presentations must provide enough background information to facilitate this\ndiscussion.\nCourse Structure\nThis course is spread over 10 weekly research seminars.\n\nWeek 3: (20 March) Introduction and Event Studies\nHenk Berkman\n\uf0b7 Kothari, S.P. and Warner, Jerold B., The econometrics of event studies, 2004.

Visual (rather than note intensive) lecture slides provided for more interesting\nlectures.\n2. Introductory lectures provided via pre-recorded videos.\n3. Nominated student note-takers for each lecture.\n4. Engaging students with in-class discussions.\n5. The course book readings, particularly the up-to-date content from industry\npublications.\n6. The team building approach the lecturer used to build connections between\nmembers of the class.\n7. The enthusiasm and approachability of the lecturer.\nAll of the above features will be retained within this year\u2019s course.\nSuggested improvements\nPrior student feedback suggested the following improvements to the course:\n1. Lecture notes: As the lecture slides are largely visual, students have to take their\nown notes. During 2016, students worked in teams to provide notes for each\nlecture. The notes were assessed against participation marks. This will be\ncontinued in 2017.\n2. Lecture recordings: Students felt it would be beneficial if the lectures were\nrecorded. It is considered that recording lectures will result in lower in-class\nparticipation (contrary to items 2, 3 and 6 that the students found to be helpful for\ntheir learning). As a result, the lectures will not be recorded. The only exceptions\nare the introductory lectures which use pre-recorded videos.\n3. Provision of lectures slides within the course book: Students suggested that\nincluding the slides within the course book would reduce their need to print slides\nduring the semester. Providing slides within the course book will limit the ability to\nadapt the content during the semester to address emerging issues and/or adapt\nthe course to address student feedback. The lectures will therefore be progressively\nuploaded as the course progresses. Where practicable, it is suggested that students\nuse digital versions of slides (rather than printed) in order to avoid printing costs.\n\n\fIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via Canvas and the university web site.\n\nAdditional Information\nLecture and Learning Protocol\nLectures will commence no later than 5 minutes past the hour and finish by 5 minutes to\nthe hour. Students are asked to attend all lectures.\nPrivate conversations, eating, drinking, disruptive mobile devices, or reading unrelated\nmaterial will not be tolerated. Lecturers will make it clear when questions can be asked;\nin most cases, student participation will be encouraged.\nTo perform well in this course, it is expected that students:\n\uf0a7\n\nAttend all lecture sessions and take notes to supplement lecture hand outs.\n\n\uf0a7\n\nAnswer questions posed by the lecturer in class (this is an essential part of the\nlearning process.\n\n\uf0a7\n\nComplete all required readings prior to the relevant lecture.\n\n\uf0a7\n\nPut in additional hours study per week going over the lecture material and\nsupplementing it with additional reading. Students are advised not to leave this\nuntil just before the test or exam.\n\n\uf0a7\n\nKeep up to date with events in the property market through all forms of media.\n\nDepartment Policy for Late Assignments and Extensions\nThe lecturer for each assignment or report will give a specific hand in date. All completed\nassignments must be handed in to the Assignment Room on Level 0 of the Owen Glenn\nBuilding before 4pm on the date specified (unless an alternative time and/or place is\nspecified).\nAssignments handed in up to 3 teaching days (or weekdays during a mid-semester break\nor study/exam period) late will automatically lose 20% of the total marks possible.\nAssignments handed in more than 3 days late and up to one week late will automatically\nlose 50% of the total marks possible. Assignments handed in more than one week after\nthe specified hand-in date and time will receive no marks.\nExtensions for assignments may only be granted by applying to the Head of Department.\nPenalties for late submission will be as per the Department of Property policy as given\nabove.

Involves the\nassessment of risk, cost of capital, financial analysis of performance, forecasting, and the\ndevelopment of recommendations for change and/or improvement.\n\nGoals of the Course\nCapstone units are generally seen to have three main aims: integrating the programme,\nreflecting on prior learning, and transitioning into the workplace.\nUsing this as a starting point, this accounting capstone is seen as an opportunity to\nintegrate the knowledge gained on the entire programme through problem based learning\nand development of a professional identity. Students will be allocated into groups of a\nmaximum of four students who will take on the personas of professional accounting\nadvisors for an entire quarter and are required to solve a series of unstructured, multidimensional accounting problems given limited facts. The process is similar to a client\napproaching a professional accounting advisor with a particular problem, and the advisor\nsolving the problem by providing advice based on assumptions and publicly available\ninformation.\nThis capstone course is designed to permit the student to exhibit judgement, critical\nthinking and communication skills, and ability to use relevant technology; all skills\ndeveloped throughout the programme. Students can demonstrate their understanding in\ncomplex problem identification and solution to solve the given problem. This enables them\nto become \u2018business ready\u2019 for their eventual engagement with companies in their future\nemployment.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course, you should be able to:\n1.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\n\n\fYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available\nat: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\nAssignment Submission\nAll assignments for this course should be submitted through the Assignments section of\nthese course webpages, after going through the standard review process. This process is\nas follows:\n1. assignment draft is run through Grammarly\n2. Grammarly report and assignment draft are submitted to the assignment draft point\nfor language, grammar and structure review and feedback by the Business\nCommunication team, and for originality checking. This draft point will close no later\nthan 24 hours before the assignment submission deadline\n3. final assignment, which incorporates the Business Communication team feedback on\nlanguage and originality, is submitted to the final submission point\nThe draft and final submission points can be found in the Assignments section of these\nwebpages.\n\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year.

General instructions\nResearch paper is a team-based assignment on a topic to be chosen by each team amongst\nthe list of topics shown below. By writing the paper students will demonstrate their abilities\nto:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nUnderstand the issues and challenges that concern a particular aspect of New Zealand\u00b4s\nUltraFast Broadband initiative.\nLocate bibliographical sources and use them to research the chosen topic thoroughly.\nContribute a comprehensive analysis and write formally.\n\nPrevious to your final submission your group will present the main issues surrounding your\ntopics and outline the contents to be considered. This will be done in a group session over\nthe last two lectures of the semester called \u201cGroup Presentations\u201d. In your presentation you\nwill demonstrate your abilities to:\n\u2022\n\nCommunicate the main questions and issues about the topic of your choice\n\n\f\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nClearly describe its background information and the current situation\nOutline the structure of your paper\nListen to the questions and comments from the audience\nMake sure the comments from any discussion that arises are used to improve your\npaper\n\nThe presentation is not necessarily a final presentation of findings or research. It is a way for\nthe group to communicate their work plan and invite their classmates\u2019 views, questions and\nopinions.\nII. Requirements\nLecturer will offer a range of topics for research (see IV. below). Select three topics and rank\nthem as most preferred to second most preferred and third most preferred. Send this info\nto f.beltran@auckland.ac.nz . Topics will be assigned on a \u201cfirst-come/first-served\u201d basis. If\ntwo or more groups choose the same most preferred topic the group with the earliest\nreceived e-mail message will get it. Your choice topic MUST be approved by the lecturer\nbefore you can start working on it.\nThe FINAL PROJECT comprises a PROPOSAL, a PRESENTATION and an ESSAY.\nThe project will start with submission of a PROPOSAL. This is a document that describes the\napproach taken by the group and outlines the contents to be discussed. PROPOSAL will be\n600 words max and 4 pages (if needed for graphics or charts). PROPOSAL must show a\nbibliographical reference list (not included in the 600 word limit). NO COVER PAGE, please.\nPROPOSALS must be submitted via Canvas before 5 p.m. on Wednesday October 11.\nOn any of the last two lectures groups will present their findings to the rest of the class. This\nis the activity known as PRESENTATION. Presentations schedule is the following (for the list\nof topics see IV. below):\nTopics 1 through 4: Monday October 16\nTopics 5 through 8: Monday October 23\nYour group will be allowed 30 minutes for your PRESENTATION, including lectern or\nprojector setup and questions and discussion. Your group is responsible for managing this\ntime slot. You may use up the full time slot or a part of it.\nYour group is free to choose the format for your presentation, in particular, who leads the\npresentation, when and for how long each team member talks, etc. Bear in mind that each\ngroup member\u00b4s contribution to the presentation will count towards this component of the\nmarks.\nESSAY is the third of the activities in the final project. This is a paper where the group must\ndemonstrate their ability to synthesize information, discuss and analyse the chosen topic.\nThough not a research paper, writing it must follow the same guideline as a research paper.\nGroups are advised to conceive the ESSAY as research exercise.\nThe ESSAY, if properly planned and executed, will add to the value of the course by\nincreasing the depth of your knowledge in one or more subject areas. As you begin your\nresearch, the reference textbooks can provide you with a useful introduction to your topic.\nWhen researching your topic, you are expected to go beyond course readings and lectures.\n\n\fESSAYS will be graded based on (1) the description of the issue(s) (statement of purpose,\nfactual accuracy, whether your description is up to date); (2) your analysis of the issue(s); (3)\nthe quality of your research (whether you find good sources, whether your sources are\ncurrent and diverse); and (4) writing mechanics (correct spelling and grammar, clarity and\nstyle, citation form, and organisation).\nYour ESSAY must be between 3,000 to 4,000 words and use 11 point font size; DO NOT use a\ncover page; do not use logos or marks or drawings on the paper header; just write the\nNAMES and UPIs of the team members.\nThe paper will be checked using the turnitin.com service. Details regarding this procedure\nwill be explained in class.\nESSAYS must be submitted via Canvas before 5 p.m. on Monday October 30. Late papers\nwill be penalised 20% per day (24 hours). For example, a paper submitted in AFTER 5pm on\nOct 31 and BEFORE 5 pm on Nov 1 will be worth 80% of a paper submitted on time. And so\non.\nOnly Canvas submissions will be accepted.\nIII. Marking Criteria\nPapers will be graded based on\n(1) the description of the issue(s) (statement of purpose, factual accuracy, whether your\ndescription is up to date);\n(2) your analysis (critical analysis) of the issue(s);\n(3) the quality of your research (whether you find good sources, whether your sources are\ncurrent and diverse); and\n(4) writing mechanics (correct spelling and grammar, clarity and style, citation form, and\norganisation).\nIV. Topics\nThe list of topics follows.\nLIST OF TOPICS WILL BE RELEASED ON DUE TIME.\nV. Topic selection process and presentation schedule.\nTopic selection process:\nEvery team MUST be three (3) students.\nOnce your team members are identified a team representative must:\n1. E-mail f.beltran@auckland.ac.nz the names and UPIs of the three team members.\n2. Include 3 topics from the list, clearly indicating what your FIRST preference, your\nSECOND preference and your THIRD preference.\nE-mails that either do not mention the three names clearly or do not list at least two topics\nwill not be considered.\nAllocation of topics will be on a First-Come, First-Served basis. Indicating at least two topics\nwill help solve any preference overlap.\n\n\f\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/INTBUS723.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2012\nINTBUS 723: GLOBAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nQuarter 3\nCourse Prescription\nProvides an understanding of global political, economic, social, technological and\necological relations, associated international institutions, and their implications for\ninternational business.

You will be making significant strategic decisions at the overall company-wide\nlevel. You will be applying your marketing knowledge from previous courses, and you will\nalso be building an appreciation for how marketing integrates and fits within the wider\ncontext of business. You will experience uncertainty, and you will experience ambiguity.\nYou will also quickly begin to realise that a company\u2019s strategy must evolve over time. In\nshort, you will gain an understanding of what senior marketing managers within a large\nglobal enterprise actually do!\nThe content outline is as follows:\n1\n\n\fLearning and Teaching\nThis course is based on experiential learning, i.e. learning by doing, through the use of a\nworld-leading business simulation. The Business Strategy Game (BSG) enables students\nto work in teams to make strategic business decisions, and to observe and learn from the\noutcomes of their decisions in a dynamic yet safe environment. There will be two classes\neach week, with a two-hour session one day that is followed by a one-hour session the\nnext day. There will be three basic learning and teaching delivery formats in which the\nthree hours per week will typically be approached, i.e. through a combination of a lecture,\nan interactive BSG workshop, plus allocated in-class team time for BSG planning and\ndecision making.\n\nTeaching Staff\nDr Michael SW Lee, Course Co-ordinator / Senior Lecturer\nOffice: Room 413, level 4, Owen Glenn Building\nTelephone: 373-7599 Ext. 85953\nE-mail: msw.lee@auckland.ac.nz\nDr Gavin Northey, Lecturer\nOffice: Room 421, level 4, Owen Glenn Building\nTelephone: 923-4950\nE-mail: g.northey@auckland.ac.nz\nDr Douglas Carrie, Director of First Year Studies / Professional Teaching Fellow\nOffice: Room 449, level 4, Owen Glenn Building\nTelephone: 373-7599 Ext. 88441\nE-mail: d.carrie@auckland.ac.nz\nHerbert Sima, Professional Teaching Fellow:\nOffice: Room 404, level 4, Owen Glenn Building\nTelephone: 373-7599 Ext. 85950\nE-mail: h.sima@auckland.ac.nz\n\n2\n\n\fChristina Huang, Course Administration Co-ordinator\nOffice: Room 437, level 4, OGGB\nE-mail: christina.huang@auckland.ac.nz\nJustene McNeice, Marketing Subject Librarian:\nOffice: Room M25, Level M (between levels 1 and 2) General Library\nTel: 09 373 7599 ext 84668\nEmail: j.mcneice@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\nThe Business Strategy Game (BSG) Simulation: This course uses the BSG simulation and\nstudents must therefore purchase an account with BSG in order to access the simulation\nand its online resources and quizzes.

There is also a bonus mark system for team engagement worth up to 2.5%\nadditional marks towards this total possible total score of 40%. While it is possible for\nsuch bonus marks to take the total Business Strategy Game Team Performance score\ncomponent of the course up to a perfect score of 40, these bonus marks cannot take this\nup beyond the maximum score of 40.\n(2) Two peer evaluation processes will take place during this course, and there will also\nbe further possible indicators of an individual\u2019s contribution to the team process. There\nwill always be natural variations in the relative contributions made by different team\nmembers, and that is not a major concern. However, significant outliers will be\ninvestigated. In the calculation of their final grades, most students will receive all\n(100%) of the Business Strategy Game Team Performance marks that were achieved by\nthe team as a whole. There will, however, be exceptions where a student has not\ncontributed to the team process and should therefore not automatically expect to receive\nall of the team marks that were achieved by the team as a whole.\n\n3\n\n\fThe broad relationship between the assessments and the course learning outcomes is:\nLearning\nOutcome\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nBusiness Strategy\nGame Performance\nand related\ndeliverables\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nBSG Quiz 1\nand\nBSG Quiz 2\n\nBSG\nPost-Simulation\nTest\n\nFinal Exam\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with any member of the teaching team.\nIf university or non-university matters are getting on top of you, please contact the\nUniversity Counselling Services.

Your feedback will help us improve the course and\nour teaching in the future.\nExpectations Regarding Classroom Behaviour: Please turn your cell phone OFF or to\nSILENT for lectures. In order to provide a good learning environment for all students, cell\nphone ringing, texting, or excessive personal chatter during lectures is unacceptable and\nmay cause you to be ejected from lectures and especially, tests. Students are expected\nto express themselves politely to one another and to their lecturer or tutor, during group\ndiscussions. Although you are welcome to bring drinking water to lectures, please be\nadvised that University Lecture Theatre Management policy does not permit food or\nbeverages to be consumed in lecture theatres. Please try to arrive at your lecture before\nit commences, and if you are unavoidably late or have to leave early, please try to\nminimise the disruption to the class.\nCommunicating with the MKTG 301 Teaching Team: The MKTG 301 Teaching Team\nconsists of lecturers, professional teaching fellows, teaching assistants and mentors, and\nMs Christina Huang (Group Services Administrator). We will be conducting all class-related\ndiscussion in Piazza this semester. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff,\nwe encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. The quicker you begin asking\nquestions on Piazza, the quicker you'll benefit from the collective knowledge of your\nclassmates and instructors. The course instructors will also be holding office hours each\nweek with the exact times to be communicated within Canvas. Any administrative queries\n(e.g. missed tests or assessments, enrolment issues etc.) should be directed to Christina\nHuang. Team problems or issues should be reported to the course co-ordinator by email\nor in person, rather than through Piazza.\nPlease refer to the Department of Marketing Undergraduate Protocol at the end of this\ncourse outline for further information regarding Department polices.\n\n4\n\n\fDEPARTMENT OF MARKETING UNDERGRADUATE PROTOCOL\nWe, the Marketing Department, regard our relationship with students as very important.\nThis is why we have written this protocol which describes the key policies and practices\nthat will help you to have a clear understanding of what you can expect from your lecturer\nand what the lecturer can expect from you. In respect to this, our overriding principles are\nconsistency and fairness in terms of how each student is treated.\nCommunication\nCourse-Coordinators, Lecturers and Tutors will always aim to communicate with you in a\ntimely and efficient manner. The main venue where the course information will be provided\nare lectures and tutorials. Additionally, the main information related to the course, such\nas deadlines for your assignments, can be found in the Course Outline. Some Course\nOutlines may be provided electronically while others are available in hardcopy.\nWe also use CANVAS software to help students keep track of their own progress, e.g.\nallowing students to check their own marks on the web. Some marketing lecturers may\nalso use CANVAS software to:\n\u25baProvide students with unrestricted access to course materials (lecture notes, case\nstudies and reference materials). Students will be able to access these materials anytime\nand anywhere via the Internet.\n\u25baKeep students informed with changes to the schedule, upcoming events, and\nopportunities for part time marketing jobs or social events.\nPlease note that the information posted on CANVAS does not fully cover information given\nin lectures. Therefore, if you miss a class, you should ask other students whether you\nhave missed any important announcements (or materials). It is your responsibility to\nmonitor, read, and keep up to date on all course communications.\nThe email address you have listed in CANVAS must be one that you use and check most\nfrequently. This is the address to which your course lecturers will send any important\nmessages and updates. Your current mailing address and other contact details must\nalways be kept up to date on Student Services Online, the University\u2019s online enrolment\nand student administration system. You can update your personal details by logging on to\nStudent Services Online and then clicking on \u201cUpdate your details\u201d.\n\n5\n\n\fGrading\nThis is the distribution that students are graded on for undergraduate courses in the\nDepartment of Marketing:\nGRADE\nA+\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\nC\nCD+\nD\nD-\n\nDESCRIPTION\nOutstanding\nExcellent\nApproaching Excellence\nVery good, comfortably meeting expectations\nGood, meets expectations\nGood, just meets expectations but minor problems\nAdequate, almost meeting expectations but minor problems\nAdequate, not quite meeting expectations because of problems\nJust adequate, not quite meeting expectations because of further\nproblems\nInadequate, further problems and below expectations\nInadequate, well below expectations because of major problems\nCompletely inadequate, well below expectations because of major\nproblems\n\n%\n90-100\n85-89\n80-84\n75-79\n70-74\n65-69\n60-64\n55-59\n50-54\n45-49\n40-44\n0-39\n\nPlease note: The grade scales are indicative only. Scaling may be applied.\nAssignments\nPlease note that group and individual assignment weightings can NOT be transferred to\nthe final exam/assessment.\nWhen handing in your assignments, please use the appropriate cover sheet, and please\nuse your official name, as is currently used in University records. You will have\nconsiderable advance notice about the date that assignments are due. Therefore, you must\nplan your work to give yourself leeway so unforeseen events such as computer problems\nor losing an assignment do not prevent you from handing the assignment in on time.\nUnacceptable reasons for a late assignment also include being overseas or other work or\nsporting commitments. Acceptable reasons for handing a late assignment might be a\nlonger period of illness prior to the deadline, unexpected incarceration or bereavement.\nHowever, in these circumstances you will be required to provide suitable documentation\nas evidence (e.g. a certificate from the campus Health Centre), as early as possible, but\nno later than the assignment due date.\nStudents will be penalised for handing in assignments after the due date. Below is a list of\npenalties that can be expected:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nday late 10% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 20% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 30% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 40% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 50% off grade achieved by student\n\nNote: Assignments handed in five minutes past the deadline are considered one day late.\nIf an assignment is due in on a Friday, then an assignment submitted on Monday is\nconsidered to be three days late. Assignments handed in later than five days after the\ndeadline will not be graded. Although these penalties may seem harsh, their purpose is to\nprepare you for the expectations your employer will have of you (i.e. planning your time\nefficiently, and meeting deadlines) while maintaining fair and equitable treatment of all\nstudents.\n\n6\n\n\fFor group assignments, all members of the group will be awarded the same group\nassignment mark, unless the course coordinator is informed of group issues that may have\nadversely affected the group work. Such issues must be brought to the attention of the\ncourse co-ordinator before the assignment due date.\nIn group assignments where peer assessment is used, students not contributing equally\nto the group effort may be penalised. Therefore students should inform their team mates,\nand the teaching staff, if they are unable to contribute equitably to the group assignment\nat any point. Once again, suitable documentation must be given to the course co-ordinator\nas early as possible, but no later than the assignment due date.\nGrading of Assessments\nStudents can expect all mid-semester tests and assignments to be graded and returned\nin tutorials within three weeks (unless otherwise specified by lecturer). Your grades will\nbe viewable on CANVAS as soon as they are available. Always remember to compare your\ngrades on CANVAS with the grades that are written on your test or assignments, and\nreport any discrepancies to your lecturer or tutor without delay.\nImportance of Mid-Semester Tests and the Final Exam\nMid-semester tests provide an opportunity for students to test their individual knowledge\nunder controlled conditions, and also allow students to practice for the final exam. The\nfinal exam is an integral part of each paper and accounts for a large percentage of your\nfinal grade. Failing the final exam may make it very difficult to pass a paper.\nIt is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of the location, time, and date of their midsemester tests and final exams. Students who miss mid-semester tests or final exams\nbecause of ill health or bereavement reasons may apply for an aegrotat or for\ncompassionate consideration (see the University Calendar/Examination Regulations for the\nrelevant procedures). Be aware that you have to apply within 7 days after the test/exam.\nNote: Acceptable reasons for missing tests/exams include documented illness of yourself\nor your dependent(s), incarceration and bereavement. Reasons such as going on vacation,\nsporting or work commitments, or getting the date and/or time of test wrong etc. are not\nacceptable. If you are disabled or have other difficulties necessitating special\naccommodation for the test/exam (e.g. a longer test time, or a separate testing room),\nplease advise the Course Coordinator as soon as possible.\nClass Representatives\nThe Marketing Department values the role of class representatives and encourages\nstudents to act in this capacity. Students are encouraged to talk to class representatives\nabout the course. Lecturers really appreciate the class representatives\u2019 feedback. This\nchannel is used as an opportunity to make improvements to the course. There are two\nformal class representative meetings during a semester. During these meetings, class\nrepresentatives have the opportunity to talk to the lecturers and the undergraduate coordinator about the overall evaluation of the course, and provide ideas and suggestions.\nDisputes\nIf you have a problem with any Marketing course, first approach your lecturer or course\nco-ordinator. If you are uncomfortable approaching your course co-ordinator then please\ncontact the Marketing Department\u2019s undergraduate co-ordinators.\nStudents who wish to query their final exam and/or final grade must do so through the\nappropriate channels (for the procedure see the University Calendar/Examination\nRegulations). You can apply only for a recount (not a remark) of your exam. Please do\nnot contact your lecturers directly because they will not be able to give out any information\non final exam marks.\n\n7\n\n\fCOPYRIGHT WARNING NOTICE\nThis material is protected by copyright and has been copied by and solely for the\neducational purposes of the University under licence.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version.

Both\nassignments serve as an exercise to help you better understand the process\nof scientific research.\n\n\u2022\n\nAssignment 1 is to be turned in on the assigned due date. In addition, an\nelectronic copy (MS Word or PDF) of the assignment needs to be submitted\nto Turnitin via Canvas. Late assignments will incur a penalty. Extensions are\ngranted in special circumstances (e.g. illness).\n\n\u2022\n\nYour assignment must be typed double-spaced with 10- or 12-point font\nand printed on both sides of the page.\n\n\u2022\n\nUse a formal, scientific writing style. Spelling and grammar errors will lower\nyour grade. You\u2019re encouraged to get editing help, particularly if you\u2019re not\naccustomed to scientific writing. Examples of this style can be found in\nacademic articles used in your literature review.\n\n\u2022\n\nAll citations should be stored and managed in a RefWorks library. This is a\nweb based tool for storing and managing bibliographic references. For more\ninformation on RefWorks go to:\nhttp://www.library.auckland.ac.nz/refworks/index.htm\n\u2022 Reference list for assignments should be generated with RefWorks. In-text\ncitations and reference list must follow the APA (American Psychological\nAssociation) referencing style, the style recommended for the Faculty of\nBusiness and Economics. For a brief guide to the style see:\nhttps://www.library.auckland.ac.nz/subjectguides/bus/topicguides/apa_for_business.htm\n\nINCLUSIVE LEARNING\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-toface and/or in written form with the course lecturer.\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nStudents evaluated this course last year and their feedback indicates that\nassignments and activities helped them learn and supported the aims of the course.\nThey also believed that their skills would help them with their research for\ndissertation/thesis. To help with their learning, students indicated that they would\nlike a set of lecture notes/PowerPoint slides to follow concepts presented in class. I\nwill be providing lecture notes prior to each meeting on Cecil.\nYou will have an opportunity to provide a formative mid-course evaluation and\ncomplete a student evaluation at the end of teaching. I encourage everyone to take\ntime and provide feedback on the course so we can continually improve the quality\nof the course.\n\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\n\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via Canvas and the university web site.\n\n\fCOPYRIGHT WARNING NOTICE\n\nThe course materials are protected by copyright.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may\nbe reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\nmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an\nelectronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to\navoid plagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\n\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to\ngive a copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\n\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs.\nReferen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/INFOSYS222.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nINFOSYS 222: DATABASE SYSTEMS (15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCourse Prescription\nManagers and other knowledge workers find that many of their duties revolve around\naccessing, organising, and presenting organisational and external information.

However, in weeks 8-11 (for 4 weeks only), the session will run for an\nadditional hour (i.e. for three hours, in total). This extra hour might called supervision in your\ntimetable (for more information please refer to the \u2018Labs\u2019 section). You are required to read the\nrelevant chapters from the prescribed textbook prior to attending classes, not only for the tests,\nbut also for you to be able to understand the content for any given week.\nMini tests: Mini tests are designed to test your knowledge based on the content (i.e. textbook\nchapter) assigned for that particular week. The test will consist of 10 multiple choice questions.\nYou are allowed to take the test twice (once before and once after the lecture) and retain the\nhighest score. These are unsupervised tests, so all you need to have is internet access and you\ncan sit them at a time and place that suits you.\nLabs: There will be four 1-hour online/computer-based sessions about the SPSS statistical\nsoftware package between weeks 8-11 right after the 2-hour lecture. These are the only four\nweeks when there will be a 3-hour session. This is an online tutorial (see supervision above),\nbut Labs 6, 7 and 12 are available if people want to attend in person. These online sessions will\nfocus on data analysis by using the SPSS software package, and they are recorded.\n\nCourse Timetable\nWeek\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nTopic\nIntroduction to Marketing Research and the\nResearch Process (Chapter 1)\nProblem Definition (Chapter 2)\nResearch Design and Secondary Data Sources\n(Chapter 3-5)\nQualitative Methods (Chapter 6)\nDescriptive Research Design (Chapter 7 & 11)\nCausal Research Design (Chapter 8)\nMid-term test (25%)\nMeasurement, Scaling and Sampling (Chapter 910, 12-13)\nData Preparation and Analysis: Hypothesis\ntesting, Frequencies (Chapter 14-15)\nSPSS online session 1\nData Analysis: Hypothesis testing and Crosstabulation (Chapter 16)\nSPSS online session 2\nData Analysis: Testing for Significant Differences,\nt-test/ANOVA (Chapter 17)\nSPSS online session 3\n\nAssessment\nMini test 1 (2%)\nGroup assignment\nMini test 2 (2%)\nGroup assignment\nMini test 3 (2%)\nGroup assignment\nMini test 4 (2%)\nGroup assignment\nMini test 5 (2%)\n\n1 (5%)\n2 (5%)\n3 (5%)\n4 (5%)\n\nMini test 6 (2%)\nMini test 7 (2%)\nGroup assignment 5 (5%)\nMini test 8 (2%)\nGroup assignment 6 (5%)\nMini test 9 (2%)\nGroup assignment 7 (5%)\n\n3\n\n\f11\n\nData Analysis: Testing for Association \u2013\nCorrelation and Regression (Chapter 18)\nSPSS online session 4\nCourse-wrap up, Exam Preparation\nFinal exam (25%)\n\n12\n\nMini test 10 (2%)\nGroup assignment 8 (5%)\n\nExpectations Regarding Classroom Behaviour: Please turn your cellphone OFF or to SILENT\nmode before your class or lab commences. In order to provide a good learning environment for\nall students, cellphone ringing, texting, or excessive personal chatter during classes or labs is\nunacceptable and may cause you to be ejected from classes, labs, and especially, tests. Students\nare expected to express themselves politely to one another and to their lecturer or tutor, during\ngroup discussions. Although you are welcome to bring drinking water to classes, please be\nadvised that University Lecture Theatre Management policy does not permit food or beverages\nto be consumed in lecture theatres or lab rooms. Please try to arrive at your class or lab before\nit commences, and if you are unavoidably late or have to leave early, please try to minimise the\ndisruption to the class.\nCommunicating with the 202 Teaching Team: The 202 Teaching Team consists of your\nlecturers, your tutor(s), and Ms. Christina Huang, the Undergraduate Course Administrator. Your\nlecturers and tutor(s) will advise you of their contact details and office hour at the first class and\nfirst lab session respectively.\n1. Outside of scheduled office hours, the BEST way to contact the members of the 202\nTeaching Team is via email. We check email every day and will get back to you generally\nwithin 24 hours.\n2. In general, queries regarding material covered in classes and assignments should be\ndirected to the lecturer. Queries regarding lab material should be directed to Dr. Laszlo\nSajtos. Administrative queries (e.g. missed test etc) should be directed to Ms. Christina\nHuang.\n3. Please DO NOT email all of us at once! If you email the wrong person, the recipient will\nforward your email to the correct person as soon as possible. If you are unsure who to\nemail your query to, email your lecturer.\n4. Please identify yourself and the course clearly (all of us are involved in more than one\npaper), and include a contact telephone number if your query is of a complicated or\nurgent nature.\n5. Please do not use text language to communicate with us. We will not reply to emails that\nare phrased rudely or that are written in text language.\n\nAssessment\n1)\n\nMini tests (20%)\n\nTen mini tests will be conducted between Week 2 and 11, but only your best eight mini-tests\nmarks will be considered. You can take your mini-tests online twice, once before and once after\nthe lecture, and the best score will count towards your grade. These mini tests will test your\nknowledge of the textbook chapters. Your lecturer will advise you of the exact format in the first\nlecture.\n2)\n\nTerm test (25%)\n\nThe first test will be 1 hour long plus 10 minutes reading time (closed book). The test will take\nplace at 6-8pm on Friday, 1 September. The test will require you to demonstrate your\nknowledge of the concepts discussed in the first half of the course. The test format will be\nadvised.\n3)\n\nGroup Assignment (30%)\n\nYou have already been randomly allocated to groups of 5. Groups are required to make 3\nsubmissions in each half of the course (i.e. 6 submissions, in total). You are allowed to make 4\n\n4\n\n\fsubmissions in each half (if you wish) from which the top three scores will be retained. Each\nsubmission is worth 5%. Further details will be provided in Lecture 1.\n4)\n\nSPSS exam (25%)\n\nYou will be required to demonstrate your competency using the SPSS statistical software\npackage and analysing the results from various statistical techniques. This is a two hour exam\n(further information on the exact location of the test to be provided in class).\n5)\n\nBest weekly question and answer (2% bonus)\n\nThis exercise aims to reward the student who will write the best question (selected by the\nlecturer) for a particular week. Students can send a question to the lecturer between 8am,\nMonday and 5pm Tuesday on any given week in Weeks 2-11. The question has to be curious,\nrelated to the actual week\u2019s topic, and it has to show a deep understanding of the content. The\nquestion also has to be challenging so that it cannot be solely answered from a textbook or the\nlecture slides. The question will be posted on Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning on Piazza\nfor all to see and answers can be posted until 5pm on Friday. Questions and answers must be\nposted non-anonymously for it to be considered for the bonus mark. Either the best question or\nthe answer or both can be rewarded with 2% each week. The student who asks the question\ncannot answer his/her own question. No more than 4% can be scored by a single student in this\nformat during each half of the semester (i.e. 8% in total for the entire semester for any student).\n\nCANVAS\nAll assignments and announcements will be published during the semester via Canvas. Make\nsure to check Canvas regularly.\nPlease refer to the Department of Marketing Undergraduate Protocol at the end of this course\noutline for further information regarding Department polices.\n\nINCLUSIVE LEARNING\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK\nWe continually improve MKTG202. Three important mechanisms for this are your feedback:\n\u2022 directly to one of the members of the teaching team\n\u2022 through the course and lecturer evaluations at the end of this course\n\u2022 on-going feedback through your class representatives\nWe cannot promise that we can implement each student\u2019s wishes with regard to MKTG202.\nWhat we CAN promise is that we will consider each reasonable request and weigh it up against\nour aims and experience in running this course.\n\n5\n\n\fDEPARTMENT OF MARKETING UNDERGRADUATE PROTOCOL\nWe, the Marketing Department, regard our relationship with students as very important. This is why we have\nwritten this protocol which describes the key policies and practices that will help you to have a clear\nunderstanding of what you can expect from your lecturer and what the lecturer can expect from you. In\nrespect to this, our overriding principles are consistency and fairness in terms of how each student is treated.\nCommunication\nCourse-Coordinators, Lecturers and Tutors will always aim to communicate with you in a timely and efficient\nmanner. The main venue where the course information will be provided are lectures and tutorials.\nAdditionally, the main information related to the course, such as deadlines for your assignments, can be\nfound in the Course Outline. Some Course Outlines may be provided electronically while others are available\nin hardcopy.\nWe also use Canvas software to help students keep track of their own progress, e.g. allowing students to\ncheck their own marks on the web. Some marketing lecturers may also use Canvas to:\n\u25baProvide students with unrestricted access to course materials (lecture notes, case studies and reference\nmaterials). Students will be able to access these materials anytime and anywhere via the Internet.\n\u25baKeep students informed with changes to the schedule, upcoming events, and opportunities for part time\nmarketing jobs or social events.\nPlease note that the information posted on Canvas does not fully cover information given in lectures.\nTherefore, if you miss a class, you should ask other students whether you have missed any important\nannouncements (or materials). It is your responsibility to monitor, read, and keep up to date on all course\ncommunications.\nThe email address you have listed in Canvas must be one that you use and check most frequently. This is\nthe address to which your course lecturers will send any important messages and updates.

Scaling may be applied.\n\n6\n\n\fAssignments\nPlease note that group and individual assignment weightings can NOT be transferred to the final\nexam/assessment.\nWhen handing in your assignments, please use the appropriate cover sheet, and please use your official\nname, as is currently used in University records. You will have considerable advance notice about the date\nthat assignments are due. Therefore, you must plan your work to give yourself leeway so unforeseen events\nsuch as computer problems or losing an assignment do not prevent you from handing the assignment in on\ntime. Unacceptable reasons for a late assignment also include being overseas or other work or sporting\ncommitments. Acceptable reasons for handing a late assignment might be a longer period of illness prior to\nthe deadline, unexpected incarceration or bereavement. However, in these circumstances you will be\nrequired to provide suitable documentation as evidence (e.g. a certificate from the campus Health Centre),\nas early as possible, but no later than the assignment due date.\nStudents will be penalised for handing in assignments after the due date. Below is a list of penalties that can\nbe expected:\n1 day late 10% off grade achieved by student\n2 days late 20% off grade achieved by student\n3 days late 30% off grade achieved by student\n4 days late 40% off grade achieved by student\n5 days late 50% off grade achieved by student\nNote: Assignments handed in five minutes past the deadline are considered one day late. If an assignment is\ndue in on a Friday, then an assignment submitted on Monday is considered to be three days late.\nAssignments handed in later than five days after the deadline will not be graded. Although these penalties\nmay seem harsh, their purpose is to prepare you for the expectations your employer will have of you (i.e.\nplanning your time efficiently, and meeting deadlines) while maintaining fair and equitable treatment of all\nstudents.\nFor group assignments, all members of the group will be awarded the same group assignment mark, unless\nthe course coordinator is informed of group issues that may have adversely affected the group work. Such\nissues must be brought to the attention of the course co-ordinator before the assignment due date.\nIn group assignments where peer assessment is used, students not contributing equally to the group effort\nmay be penalised. Therefore students should inform their team mates, and the teaching staff, if they are\nunable to contribute equitably to the group assignment at any point. Once again, suitable documentation\nmust be given to the course co-ordinator as early as possible, but no later than the assignment due date.\nGrading of Assessments\nStudents can expect all mid-semester tests and assignments to be graded and returned in tutorials within\ntwo weeks (unless otherwise specified by lecturer). Your grades will be viewable on Canvas as soon as they\nare available. Always remember to compare your grades on Canvas with the grades that are written on your\ntest or assignments, and report any discrepancies to your lecturer or tutor without delay.\nImportance of Mid-Semester Tests and the Final Exam\nMid-semester tests provide an opportunity for students to test their individual knowledge under controlled\nconditions, and also allow students to practice for the final exam. The final exam is an integral part of each\npaper and accounts for a large percentage of your final grade. Failing the final exam may make it very\ndifficult to pass a paper.\nIt is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of the location, time, and date of their mid-semester tests and\nfinal exams. Students who miss mid-semester tests or final exams because of ill health or bereavement\nreasons may apply for an aegrotat or for compassionate consideration (see the University\nCalendar/Examination Regulations for the relevant procedures). Be aware that you have to apply within 7\ndays after the test/exam. Links to the Exam and AEGROTAT/COMPASSIONATE information page:\n\u2022 http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/cs-examination-information\n\u2022 http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/cs-aegrotat-and-compassionate-consideration\nNote: Acceptable reasons for missing tests/exams include documented illness of yourself or your\ndependent(s), incarceration and bereavement. Reasons such as going on vacation, sporting or work\ncommitments, or getting the date and/or time of test wrong etc. are not acceptable. If you are disabled or\n\n7\n\n\fhave other difficulties necessitating special accommodation for the test/exam (e.g. a longer test time, or a\nseparate testing room), please advise the Course Coordinator as soon as possible.\nClass Representatives\nThe Marketing Department values the role of class representatives and encourages students to act in this\ncapacity. Students are encouraged to talk to class representatives about the course. Lecturers really\nappreciate the class representatives\u2019 feedback. This channel is used as an opportunity to make\nimprovements to the course. There are two formal class representative meetings during a semester. During\nthese meetings, class representatives have the opportunity to talk to the lecturers and the undergraduate coordinator about the overall evaluation of the course, and provide ideas and suggestions.\nDisputes\nIf you have a problem with any Marketing course, first approach your lecturer or course co-ordinator. If you\nare uncomfortable approaching your course co-ordinator then please contact the Marketing Department\u2019s\nundergraduate co-ordinators: Catherine Frethey-Bentham (Rm. 414 OGGB, e-mail:\nc.bentham@auckland.ac.nz) or Charlotta Windahl (Rm. 419 OGGB, e-mail: c.windahl@auckland.ac.nz)\nStudents who wish to query their final exam and/or final grade must do so through the appropriate channels\n(for the procedure see the University Calendar/Examination Regulations). You can apply only for a recount\n(not a remark) of your exam. Please do not contact your lecturers directly because they will not be able to\ngive out any information on final exam marks.\n\n8\n\n\fAttachment:\nCOPYRIGHT WARNING NOTICE\nThis material is protected by copyright and has been copied by and solely for the educational\npurposes of the University under licence.

The course reading material contained in both the course book and\nCanvas Modules is a collection of relevant writings specific to each topic. Each week\u2019s\nstudy notes will contain further readings for those interested in that week\u2019s topic.\nThis course book (or equivalent online Canvas pdf files) is REQUIRED reading for this\ncourse. It is expected that students come to class prepared by reading the material for\nthe week PRIOR to the week\u2019s lectures. Lectures are prepared with the assumption that\nstudents have read the material from the course book for that week. Due to the volume\nof material that is covered in this course, it is impossible for lecturers to cover some\n\n\fdetails that are contained in the readings. It is expected that students will read the course\nbook, as any material presented in lectures or in the course book may appear in\nassessments or examinations.\nSubject to the risk of technical failures, lectures in the first half of the semester will be\nrecorded and slides will be made available shortly before each lecture session. During\nthe second half of the semester, lectures WILL NOT BE RECORDED. Because we will\nbe relying on guest lecturers and/or the presentation/discussion of commercially\nsensitive material, recording of lecture sessions in the second half of the semester is\nSTRICTLY FORBIDDEN. Students are referred to the University of Auckland copyright\npolicies and guidelines surrounding unauthorised recording or images being taken in\nlectures. Students engaging in such activity are subject to penalties outlined in the\nAcademic Standards and Conduct Guidelines, which include expulsion from the\nuniversity.\n\nAssessment\nThe following assessments will be conducted throughout the term to determine the grade\nfor the course:\nAssessment Method\nMid-Term Test\nCase Study\nCase Discussion 1\nCase Discussion 2\nCase Discussion 3\nCase Discussion 4\nFinal Examination\nLearning\nOutcome\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nPercentage of\nGrade for\n20%\n10%\n5%\n5%\n5%\n5%\n50%\n\nMid-Term\nTest\nX\nX\nX\n\nCase Study\nAssignment\nX\nX\nX\n\nDue Date (subject\nto change)\nAugust 30\nEnd of Week 7\nBeginning of Week 9\nBeginning of Week 10\nBeginning of Week 11\nBeginning of Week 12\nTBA\nCase Discussions\n1-4\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nFinal\nExam\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nThe Case Discussion Assignments will consist of a detailed analysis of key issues\npresented in lectures and the case presented during the previous week.

The class will be run with a similar focus on strategic property\nmanagement to complement the operational property management content from\nPROPERTY 231. Jeremy encourages all feedback at any time aimed at improving the\nlearning experience for your class, rather than waiting until the end of the semester.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\n\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University\nhas contingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your\nassessment is fair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in\nemergencies. In the event of a disruption, the University and your course\ncoordinators will make every effort to provide you with up to date information via\ncanvas and the university web site.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/ECON711.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nECON 711: MACROECONOMICS THEORY AND POLICY\n(15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1163)\n___________________________________________________________\nCourse Prescription\nThis is a core course that provides an advanced treatment of some fundamental topics in\nmacroeconomic theory.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\n\n\fThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available\nat: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\n\fAssignment Submission\nAll assignments for this course should be submitted through the Assignments section of\nthese course webpages, after going through the standard review process. This process is\nas follows:\n1. assignment draft is run through Grammarly\n2. Grammarly report and assignment draft are submitted to the assignment draft point\nfor language, grammar and structure review and feedback by the Business\nCommunication team, and for originality checking.

It also complements\nECON 322 Applied Econometrics.\nStudents require ECON 301 (Advanced\nMicroeconomics), ECON 311 (Advanced Macroeconomics) ECON 321 before embarking on\npostgraduate study in Economics. Students should also note that econometrics at this\nlevel requires a reasonable level of mathematical expertise.\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe aim of this course is to provide a good understanding of the properties of econometric\nmodels and techniques. Econometrics can be described as the science and art of building\nand using models in economics. More specifically it is concerned with the use of statistical\nmethods to attach numerical values to the parameters of economic models and also with\nthe use of these models for prediction. The techniques of econometrics consist of a blend\nof economic theory, mathematical modelling and statistical analysis.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected the student will be able to:\n1.\n\nderive properties of some important estimators such as least squares, maximum\nlikelihood and instrumental variables in a number of specific modelling contexts of a\nsort which arise frequently in econometric work;\n\n2.\n\nanalyse certain classes of single and multiple equation models, including some time\nseries models;\n\n3.\n\ndemonstrate an ability to explain the essential features of such models by reference\nto specified definitions and concepts, including notions of identification, specific classes\nof structural and reduced form estimators, and stationary and non-stationary time\nseries.\n\n4.\n\naccess and manipulate data electronically using a combination of computer packages,\nincluding spreadsheets and statistical software;\n\n\f2.\n\nECON 321 Course Outline 2017\n\nContent Outline\nWeek 1:\nWeeks 2-4:\n\nReview of Matrix, Probability and Statistics;\nIntroduction and Review of the Linear Regression Model;\nHeteroskedasticity, Autocorrelation, Generalized Least Squares; Maximum\nLikelihood\nWeek 5:\nBinary Dependent Variable\nWeek 6:\nEndogeneity and Instrumental Variables Estimation;\nWeeks 7-10: Time Series Econometrics (Autoregressive Moving Average models; Vector\nauto-regressions; Unit Root and Cointegration testing);\nWeeks 11-12: Panel Data Econometrics\nThis is an indicative timeline only.\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThis course will be held in semester one.

The in-class assignment teams should remain the same throughout the\ncourse. The detailed instructions and the needed background information for the in-class\nassignments are given during the sessions. The in-class assignments are graded using\nthe following criteria:\na) Correct & rigorous use of the provided framework / concept\nb) Realistic recommendations that flow logically from the analysis\nc) Level of creativity in analysis and recommendations\nThe in-class assignments are documented electronically, so the students should ensure\nthat at least one person from each team has a laptop with them.\n3. \u201cLetter to the CEO\u201d report (40% of the final grade). After the sessions, students\nare expected to write a \u201cLetter to the CEO\u201d report, in which they apply the relevant\ntopics from the modules to their own organization / current place of employment.\nThe report must cover the following three areas:\na) Analysis of the organization\u2019s current strategy.\nb) Recommendation on how the organization\u2019s strategy could be changed in the\nfuture.\nc) Recommendation on how to implement the recommended changes in strategy.\nThe deliverables should contain one-page letter to the CEO (\u201cexecutive summary\u201d) and a\nmore detailed report to complement the letter (max. length 10 pages, excluding\nreferences) explaining the analyses and the rationale for the recommendations in more\ndetail.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\n\n\fThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you. You are also\nrequired to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work, not an\nelectronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if required.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHelp with academic referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-toface and/or in written form with the lecturer.\n\nStudent Feedback\nFormative feedback surveys\nDuring the early part of the quarter (usually Week 3 or 4), short feedback surveys are\nadministered to all students to get a snapshot of how they are coping with their new\ncourses. This qualitative data, which is administered, collected and collated by the\nProgramme Office, is designed as an \u2018early warning\u2019 system of any significant issues with\nthe course that might need addressing quickly. Lecturers are asked to provide a brief\nreport to the Director of MBA on key items identified and proposed actions. Lecturers are\nalso asked to provide a verbal report to the class, proposing any solutions as\nappropriate.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nThe University of Auckland evaluates the quality of teaching and of courses by using the\nthe Summative Evaluation Tool, or SET. Summative evaluation is formal, summative\nevaluation of teaching undertaken according to University policy and is conducted at the\nend of a semester/quarter through the use of the formal University SET instruments.\nSummative evaluation is used by teachers to reflect on their teaching practice, and is\nalso used by the University for quality assurance of teaching and courses.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via Canvas and the university web site.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/PROPERTY261.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nPROPERTY 261: PROPERTY ECONOMICS (15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCourse Prescription\n\nThe supply and demand characteristics of urban developments have impacts on not only\nthe price and availability of property, but on how we live and work. An understanding of\ndevelopment economics, urban policy and land-use economics will provide students with\nknowledge of how the decisions of property professionals, policy makers, and occupiers\ninteract to shape the built environment.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\nPrerequisite: PROPERTY 102 OR ECON 101 or 191\nThe course is designed for students that have elementary knowledge of microeconomics\n(i.e. supply/demand curves) and a cursory knowledge of the macroeconomy (i.e.\nindicators\nlike\nGDP\nused\nto\ndescribe\neconomies).\nThis\ncourse\nfavours\ndiagrammatic/conceptual models & historical experience over mathematical/statistical\nmodels. The few mathematical models in this course will be constrained to basic\nalgebraic techniques. Knowledge of differential equations or matrix algebra is not\nrequired.\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nThis course provides students with an introduction to key conceptual models of urban\nland-use, including examples of their application in the context of property development,\nprivate housing, social housing, planning, and environmental sustainability. Key property\nsectors are examined (Industrial, Commercial, and Residential) using local and\ninternational examples.\nIn addition, this course develops critical reading comprehension and critical writing skills\nas part of the major essay assignment. These skills are currently top of the wishlist when\nthe property department solicits advice from industry on what is needed in the\nworkplace.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course, it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\ncritically apply urban economic theory to property issues using written\ncommunication;\napply economic theory to a wide range of property contexts;\noutline and critically evaluate residential, industrial, and retail location theories;\naccount for housing tenure dynamics both nationally and internationally;\nevaluate the role of government and public policy in urban property markets; and\ncritically consume and evaluate local market analysis reports.\n\n\fLearning and Teaching\n\nThe anticipated class size should not exceed 120 students. The class will meet for three\nhours each week (yes, the scheduling gods were rather mean this year\u2026 but I promise to\nmake it interesting!). Class time will be used for a combination of lectures, workshops\nand applied discussions. In addition to attending classes, students should prepare to\nspend about another six hours per week on activities related to this course. These\nactivities include carrying out the required readings, preparing assignments and revising\nfor the final exam.\nMy lecture sessions will be recorded.

These activities will consist of the popular in-class\nquiz tournaments from last year as well as a new application, Slido, being tested to\n\u201cstump the lecturer\u201d with questions on the content during lecture.\nMany students find the essay demanding. Critical writing (and reading) is an essential\nskill that will define your career and not one most students use recreationally. This\ncourse is one of the last times you can practice your writing skills in a safe, encouraging\nenvironment. Based on my reflection with last year\u2019s cohort, what makes the essay\ndemanding is (1) procrastination [to offset this I present students with a series of explicit\nmilestones/dates during the Assignment Introduction Lecture], and (2) poor reading\ncomprehension skills.\nTo prepare your critical reading & writing skills, the next time you read an interesting\nopinion article on the web or newspaper, seek out the primary source (i.e. the\nreport/book/plan/etc. that is being discussed), read (or skim if it\u2019s long) the primary\nsource, and write a 500 word \u201cblog post\u201d of your own opinion. Do not allow the opinion\nwriter\u2019s opinion to direct or guide your thinking. Share your post with friends - or even\nwith me! You\u2019ll be surprised how putting your thoughts on paper makes your thinking\nmore robust and logical.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\n\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised.

Students must attend at least six Departmental research seminars during the course of the\nsemester.\n\nResearch proposal (100%)\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to develop and clarify a potential research project that you\nand your supervisor are confident is realistic, achievable, and well-grounded in an\nappropriate literature review and methodology.\nFormat\nThe research design should include:\nA. Introduction \u2013 about 1000 words\n\u2022 Proposed title\n\u2022 Research question\n\u2022 Set the scene: What is the research about? Why does it interest you? Why is it\nacademically important or interesting? Is it also important or interesting to\npractitioners?\n\u2022 Background: What knowledge, if any, do you already have about the empirical\nsituation you are addressing, if you are doing empirical research?\nB. Literature Review \u2013 about 5000 words:\n\u2022 Your literature review will lay the conceptual groundwork for a potential contribution\nto that topic, by developing a relevant research question. What is original about what\nyou want to do?\n\u2022 You should construct an argument, rather than merely providing a description of the\nrelevant literature. You should argue the need for, and relevance of, your research\nquestion by setting it within the context of past research. This requires that you\ncritically evaluate and synthesise the relevant literature to demonstrate the\nsignificance and value of your study.\n\u2022 The literature review will culminate with the expression of logical hypotheses,\npropositions, and/or a conceptual framework.\nC. Discussion of conceptual framework or explanation of hypotheses. \u2013 about 1000 words\n\u2022 In this brief section you explain your reasoning behind your hypotheses and/or\nconceptual framework.\nD. Methodology \u2013 about 1500 words\n\u2022 Which research strategies and philosophies of knowledge will you draw on? What\nkind of design will be used and why?\n\u2022 Methods: what exactly will you be doing? What are the data collection methods to be\nused? What types of data should be collected? How will this be done? What could be\nthe problems of collecting these types of data? How will access be gained to\nparticipants and organisations? How many studies (interviews, surveys,\nobservations, etc.) will be conducted and why? In which ways will the methods and\ndesign answer your research questions?\n\u2022 Analysis: What, in general terms, will be done with the data you collect? What kinds\nof analytical techniques is it likely you will use? What are their limitations? How will\nthese analyses address and answer the research questions? How are you going to\nconstruct your argument, i.e., how are you going to draw together theory and data\n\n\f\u2022\n\u2022\n\nin a way that allows readers to follow you and be able to judge for themselves the\njudgements or conclusions you have reached?\nEthical considerations: Are there potential conflicts of interest, or areas of ethical\nsensitivity which may occur before, during or after the research? What cultural or\ncross-cultural issues are relevant?\nCredibility: How do you address the issues of reliability and validity or\ntrustworthiness that are relevant to your methodology?\n\nE. Planning \u2013 about 1000 words\n\u2022 Research skills: Which professional experience or research training do you already\nhave that will be relevant to this project? Which aspects of your research skills would\nyou like to improve?\n\u2022 Resources: What kind of resources, e.g., budget; equipment, etc. will you need to\ncomplete this project?\n\u2022 Timetable: Give a timetable with dates for each milestone. Include a Plan B \u2013 what\nwill you do if you cannot get the data you are planning for by the dates you have in\nmind? What alternative sources or types of data will you use?\nF. Conclusion (no more than 200 words) and References (as required)\n\u2022 A brief conclusion of your research proposal.\n\u2022 Accurate reference list of all work cited.\nAssessment criteria\nOverall, the research proposal should take the form of an academic essay and include an\nappropriate structure that demonstrates an ability to:\n\u2022 understand the theoretical aspects of research design, especially methodology\n\u2022 design a viable and realistic project.\n\u2022 argue convincingly for the academic credibility of the project.\n\u2022 understand ethical issues in research.\n\u2022 explain the relevance of all these issues to your project in your own words.\n\u2022 produce research documents to a professional academic standard.\n\u2022 write proficiently and in an interesting manner.\nIn particular, the literature review component should:\n\u2022 involve a critical evaluation of the relevant literature\n\u2022 be referenced appropriately\n\u2022 present the construction of an argument to demonstrate the relevance of your\nresearch question\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with any member of the teaching team.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/PROPERTY281.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nPROPERTY 281: BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\n\nCourse Prescription\nKnowledge of construction is vital in understanding property valuation, property management\nand property development.

Students valued this blended learning approach\nand appreciated the provision of participation marks to encourage keeping up with the course\nschedule. Students also valued the in-class review sessions which featured the Top Hat student\nresponse system with students responding in real-time to questions and then competing headto-head with their peers in a virtual tournament. The review sessions were streamed live online\nvia the Business School\u2019s video streaming server. This enabled students to participate remotely\nand enjoy a similar experience as their classmates who attended the live, in-class sessions.\n\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is fair,\nand not compromised.

Theories are developed through hypotheses, e.g. Hypothesis = if one lets go of\nsomething it will fall to the ground. This hypothesis can be tested and proved, and helps\nus to understand the mechanics of gravity. Thus, theories help extend our\nunderstanding the world.\nEssays can be descriptive (describe what something is like), or prescriptive (explain\nwhat something should be like). They are used to answer, or pose, questions. For the\nacademic community the essay is a means of conveying the findings of research in an\ninternationally recognised format. Essays must be rigorous to be acceptable to peers of\nthe researcher, who evaluate that research and its findings. Rigorous\u201d means that the\nfindings given in the essay are based on extensive study, using recognised methods and\ndrawing on existing knowledge to formulate an informed proposition, rather than\nexpressing a personal opinion. The latter writing style is more commonly referred to as\n\u201cjournalise\u201d, and is often found in newspapers or non-academic texts.\nSecondary & Primary data\nThe academic literature and written sources, which are used as a reference, are termed\n\u201csecondary data\u201d, because the reader makes use of \u201csecond-hand\u201d information,\ncollected and analysed by someone else. Oral tradition, if published in a written format,\nor recorded as audio or video, is still considered secondary data, collected and curated\nby someone else. \u201cPrimary data\u201d is first-hand, collected by the researcher, and may\ninclude observation, interviewing, surveying and experiments conducted either in the\nlaboratory or field. When making use of \u2018primary data\u2019, as a university student, one\nneeds to first gain ethics approval from that institution. Then, one needs to outline the\nmethodology (method or means) used to collect the data. This enables the study to be\nreplicated and ensures that research is rigorous. There are numerous examples of\ndubious research findings, which were later proven to be false or outrageous, either\nbecause the methodology was not rigorous or the researcher misrepresented their\nfindings to promote their particular perspective. If students on this course consult with\ntheir elders, kaum\u0101tua and kuia, and seek their cultural expertise, one does not need\nethics approval, because you are drawing on their specialist knowledge and skills.\nHowever, as Kaupapa M\u0101ori researchers, you must always act respectfully, and\nethically, and adhere to institutional and M\u0101ori ethical principles.\nSurvey of Literature\nTo answer essay questions you should begin with a survey of the relevant literature\n(secondary data). We provide an extensive list of readings, which will be of value for\neach assignment, but it is strongly recommended that students extend their knowledge\nof written resources relating to these topics by making use of the libraries on and off\ncampus. It is predominantly from the literature that the information, data and evidence\nwill be found to support your conclusions and answers.\n\n8\n\n\fHE MAHI TINO H\u0112\nCHEATING & PLAGIARISM\nHUANGA M\u0100ORI\nCHEATING AND PLAGIARISM\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may\nbe reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\nmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic\nversion of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\nINCLUSIVE LEARNING\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face- toface and/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK\nFormative feedback surveys\nDuring the early part of the quarter (usually Week 3 or 4), short feedback surveys are\nadministered to all students to get a snapshot of how they are coping with their new\ncourses. This qualitative data, which is administered, collected and collated by the\nProgramme Office, is designed as an \u2018early warning\u2019 system of any significant issues with\nthe course that might need addressing quickly.\nLecturers are asked to provide a brief report to the Director GSM MBA on key items\nidentified and proposed actions. Lecturers are also asked to provide a verbal report to the\nclass, proposing any solutions as appropriate.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nThe University of Auckland evaluates the quality of teaching and of courses by using the\nSummative Evaluation Tool, or SET. Summative evaluation is formal, summative\nevaluation of teaching undertaken according to University policy and is conducted at the\nend of a semester/quarter through the use of the formal University SET instruments.\nSummative evaluation is used by teachers to reflect on their teaching practice, and is\nalso used by the University for quality assurance of teaching and courses.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University\nhas contingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your\n\n9\n\n\fassessment is fair, and not compromised.

This intensive course\nintegrates and builds on knowledge and skills developed across the Part III and IV courses\nin the MIntBus and MMktg specialist courses in order to ensure that graduates are\nequipped with the practical and strategic skills, habits and tools to scan the macro/global,\nstrategic/organisational and micro/personal levels of their environment. Many of these\nskills and tools will be subsequently applied in the BUSINT/BUSMKT 711 Consultancy\nProjects. This course selects six current issues, two macro, through two strategic and two\nat the micro/firm level.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n1. demonstrate an advanced ability to analyse and link International Business/Marketing\nstrategies;\n2. identify and analyse recent strategic issues in International Business/Marketing;\n3. conduct secondary research to produce a comprehensive analysis and presentation of\na current organisational case study; and\nThe course is delivered in an intensive three-week block which complements preparation\nfor the consultancy project, and will comprise an in-depth analysis of six current issues in\nInternational Business/Marketing. We will focus on the following questions:\n1. Understanding the next economic giants: CIVETS1, MINT2, N-113, 3G4: What are the\nmethods, issues and prospects for \u2018picking winners\u2019?\n2. New Free Trade Agreements: How do firms adapt their strategies?\n3. Does Country of Origin matter in strategies and branding?\n\n1\n\n\f4.

The course involves critical thinking and developing persuasive\narguments which rely on knowledge of the international business/marketing environment,\nidentifying business-relevant examples and interpreting relationships between the factors\nand themes, and the significance of their effects. The course will equip you to formulate\ndifferent perspectives and be able to position yourself more effectively in your international\nbusiness or marketing career.\n\n3\n\n\fThis course has 100% in-course assessment with as much tailoring to individual interests\nas possible. This is made up of a mix of individual written assignments which build on each\nother to form one report, personal reflections, and an in-class presentation.\nThis mix of activities enables you to produce a cumulative written submission that builds\nup and offers practice and the opportunity to receive feedback on your report writing which\nwill be useful for the consultancy output. The assignments build up, and the final\npresentation can thus reinforce and give feedback on the essential oral communication\nskills you will also need for your consultancy project presentation and your future career.\n\nAssessment summary\nWeek\n1\n(10%)\n2\n(15%)\n3\n(75%)\nTotal\n\nWritten\nsubmissions\n5\n\nPersonal\nreflections\n5\n\nPresentations\n\n10\n\n5\n\n-\n\n40\n\n10\n\n25\n\n55%\n\n20%\n\n25%\n\n-\n\n1. Personal reflections (20%)\nTo stimulate discussion in class and to test out your ideas, from the second day\n(Tuesday 20th June) there will be an Applications Discussion at the beginning of class\nfor which you are asked to speak (without power point slides) for 5 minutes on your\npersonal reflection on the potential application of the week\u2019s topics to your consultancy\norganisation or to your own professional context. This is for you to show your engagement\nwith the material and to stimulate active learning and participation by others. The key\nquestions you will need to ask yourself include:\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\nWhat do you think is important?\nWhat new information or knowledge did you gain?\nHow can you use this?\nWhat would you like to share with the rest of us?\n\nAll students will be called upon and this will form part of the grade. There is no group\nassessment in this course and, although the course is graded individually, discussion and\nanalysis in study groups is encouraged. In the reflections and discussions students gain\ncredit for insights, integration of ideas, and clear communication. Those who miss classes\nwill obviously miss the opportunity to earn these grades. I expect you to get more\nconfident with this, so it is worth more marks in Week 3. There are 6 reflections sessions,\n2 each week, and I will take your best grade for each week as your final grade for this\ncomponent.\nTo demonstrate active learning and participation involves:\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\nBeing fully prepared;\nShowing enthusiasm and engagement with the material;\nOffering insightful comments and questions;\nBuilding on others\u2019 contributions;\nGiving constructive criticism of others\u2019 contributions;\nSharing in the shaping of the discussion;\nIntegrating what others have said;\nCommunicating effectively and concisely.\n\n4\n\n\fEach student will make two weekly contributions to class discussion by giving their\nreflection on the application of the material covered in each topic. This is graded as: A\nrange = 4-5%, B range = 2.4-3%, C range = 1-2%. The overall quality and insight of\ncomments and contribution to class discussion will be assessed by the lecturer, but general\nguidelines for assessing the quality of the comments made in class are as follows:\nExcellent participation (As) = Always very well-prepared for class, always able to comment\non the reading and their own readings, analysis and reflection on the material. Outstanding\ninsights will warrant an excellent grade. Consistently contributes meaningfully and\nenthusiastically to class discussions, and shows active listening by responding\nconstructively to the lecturer and other members of the group.\nVery good participation (Bs) = Well-prepared for class, able to comment to some extent\non the readings and their analysis of them, demonstrated by a high level of meaningful\nparticipation in class discussion. Demonstrates active listening by providing quality\nresponses to the lecturer and other students\nAcceptable participation (Cs) = Generally prepared for class, contributing comments in\nclass. Responds to the class discussion with less insight than for \u2018very good\u2019 and \u2018excellent\u2019\nparticipation, but demonstrating a clear understanding of the topic.\nInadequate participation (0) = The preparation for class is not demonstrated in\ncontributions to class discussions. Contributes infrequently, or fails to demonstrate insight\ninto the topic under discussion. May have to be called upon to contribute.\nFor further details about the marking of this participation, see the rubric at the end of this\ndocument.\nGrades will be made available weekly and students may see the lecturer to elicit feedback\non their participation performance or on any other aspect of the course.\n2. Written assignments (55%)\nThere are five parts, which build into one report. For each week\u2019s topics you are to use the\nreadings and find at least two other sources of information about the topic \u2013 which adds\nup to 3 sources per topic including the set reading, so you will have at least 15 references\nin the final report.\nUsing your consultancy company as a focus, you will find out more about what each of the\ncurrent issues and themes in international business and marketing means for that context\nand how each topic applies now or could have an impact on it in the future. The aim is to\nanalyse the issues or themes, assess their importance and present a solution to address\ntheir strategic impact. NB: You may not use any of the written work you submit for\nthis course in your consultancy report. A draft of each part should be reviewed by the\nBusiness Communication team through their draft Turnitin submission point prior to final\nsubmission to me in Canvas and in hard copy either in class or in the BUSINT/BUSMKT\n706 mailbox on Level 3.\nWeek 1\nPart 1 (5%): Write an introductory paragraph that explains to me what (consultancy)\ncontext you will focus on.

There have also been personnel changes involving the staff responsible\nfor teaching the course.\nFeedback on the content of the course and its delivery are sought during the course by the\nteaching staff through the medium of fast feedback during the course. In addition, formal course\nevaluations are carried out at the end of the course. As a result of feedback, some changes have\nbeen implemented this quarter. These include more contents on how contracts are administered\nand managed and how to comply with the law regarding misleading conduct.\nYour feedback, both during the course and at its completion, is sought and encouraged. You can\ncontact your class representatives to pass on your feedback to ensure your anonymity or you can\ncontact the teaching or program staff direct.\nClass representatives will be chosen in the first week of the course and their details posted on\nCanvas.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat, and views\ncheating in coursework as a serious academic offence. The work that a student submits for grading\nmust be the student's own work, reflecting his or her learning. Where work from other sources is\nused, it must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This requirement also applies to sources\non the world-wide web. A student's assessed work may be reviewed against electronic source\nmaterial using computerised detection mechanisms.

Covers the analysis and design requirements of web\napplications. Builds applied skills in developing web-based solutions to practical business\nproblems.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: INFOMGMT 192\nRestriction: INFOSYS 220\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe overall course objective is to promote the conceptual and skill based learning\nneeded to understand the process of analysing and designing information systems\nfrom the perspective of a Business Systems Analyst (BSA). A BSA works with the\nbusiness to understand their needs, but their speciality and focus is the business\u2019\nneeds related to information systems. The course concentrates on the front-end of the\nsystems development process; that is, the analysis process. The analysis process\nprovides a strong basis for understanding and modelling the user needs in an\ninformation system solution. The course touches on project planning and\nmanagement aspects, and the design of computer programs in order to provide an\noverview of the whole information system development process. The development of\nskills is stimulated through class material, practice in class, laboratories and\nassignments, and through interaction with the teaching team. In the final project,\nstudents, working in teams, will practice the major steps and techniques in the whole\ninformation systems development process: from gathering information through to\nimplementation, and documentation of the implemented system.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. describe the different Information Systems development methodologies, and the\nmajor systems development lifecycles used in developing Information Systems and\nthe considerations involved in choosing the appropriate one;\n2. identify the major activities and deliverables involved in each phase of a basic system\ndevelopment lifecycle (SDLC);\n\n\f3. perform the major activities involved in the analysis phase of a basic system\ndevelopment lifecycle (SDLC) \u2013 applying the appropriate strategies and techniques;\n4. demonstrate familiarity with the set of typical tasks and techniques used by Business\nSystems Analysts to design an information systems solution to meet business\nrequirements, such as reading and creating simple models to design a solution;\n5. analyse a business need for information and develop an appropriate strategy to solve\nthe problem to provide the required information solution;\n6. produce the requisite systems documentation at each point in the analysis of an\ninformation system, and to do so with clarity and completeness;\n7. design and develop a user interface; and\n8. work as a team to identify and apply the basics of project management.\n\nContent Outline\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\n\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n\nIntroduction to Business Systems Analysis and the SDLC\nPlanning phase techniques\nAnalysis phase techniques\nAnalysis phase modelling\nAnalysis phase modelling\nAnalysis phase modelling\nDesign phase techniques\nDesign phase techniques\nImplementation phase considerations\nImplementation phase considerations\nOperations and Maintenance phase considerations\nAgile methodologies\n\nAn exact lecture-by-lecture outline will be provided during semester.\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThe course is delivered in three one-hour lectures and one two-hour laboratory each\nweek.

Major themes include: objectives and procedures\nof internal control, the database approach to data management, data modelling, typical\nbusiness documents and reports and proper system documentation through data flow diagrams\nand flowcharts.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: INFOSYS 110 or 120 and ACCTG 102 or 192\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe course aims to provide a critical understanding of Accounting Information Systems (AIS)\nthat will enable graduates to practice the subject in an effective manner. As technology\nhas continued to develop, accounting has become increasingly dependent on information\nsystems, to the point where it is now viewed as a subset of information systems. Accounting\ninformation is central to many different activities inside and outside an organisation. The\ninformation that can be generated by an accounting system is diverse and informs the\ndecisions of internal and external stakeholders. Therefore, AIS encompass the development\nand distribution of economic information about organisations for internal and external decisionmaking.\nThe course explores, in detail, several typical AIS application subsystems, such as revenue,\npayment, payroll, and production cycles. The course covers topics including the role of\naccounting information, business processes, system mapping and documentation, transaction\ncycles, business environment and the control of risk. The course also endeavours to develop\nskills that will enable graduates to critically analyse and evaluate the existing AIS and\npropose control procedures that are appropriate and sensible.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1.\n\nappreciate how information systems, particularly accounting information systems, can\nassist in attaining organisational objectives, and how they can improve planning and\ncontrol at all levels of the organisation;\n\n2.\n\nappreciate the technical nature of (and interrelations between) physical resource flows,\nsource documentation, financial flows, internal controls, accounting information\nprocedures, and management control systems for both manual and computerised\n\n-1-\n\n\faccounting information systems;\n3.\n\nunderstand business processes and accounting cycles: how accounting transactions are\ninitiated, processed and recorded and the operational and information functions of\nseveral major AIS subsystems, how these subsystems interface with one another, and\nthe principle inputs, processes, files and outputs associated with these subsystems;\n\n4.\n\ndocument and/or interpret a system using flow charts and assess the differences between\ncomputerised processing systems and manual systems;\n\n5.\n\nunderstand internal controls (both computerised and manual) and associated risks and\ncritically evaluate and design the structure of internal control elements with business\nprocesses and accounting cycles; and\n\n6.\n\napply accounting principles and theoretical skills to case-based scenarios.\n\nContent Outline\nAn outline of the course content is provided below.

They are \u201clectures\u201d in that they are held in a large\nplenary theatre, but we will do far more in-class problem-solving and case analysis than you\nmight expect in a typical \u201clecture\u201d class. The in-class work is designed to apply the concepts\nand techniques described in the text to real-world business cases and build the skills to\ndocument, analyse, and improve accounting information systems. To succeed in this course,\nit is highly recommended that you:\n1. Prepare for each class. Read the assigned material and print the class notes before\ncoming to class. Review problems that we worked through in the previous class, and\nattempt the problems that we will cover in the next class.\n2. Engage during class. Eliminate distractions (e.g., put cell phones away, don\u2019t use your\nlaptop), add your own notes to the printed class notes, and ask questions (either during\nclass or afterwards in help/office hours).\n3. Complete all assessments. Smaller assessments (e.g., weekly online quizzes) provide\npractice and feedback on a regular, ongoing basis that prepare you for larger\nassessments (the mid-semester test and final exam).\n4.

These policies\ncover topics such as handing in assignments, granting extensions, group projects, etc.\nChapters and final report submission\nChapters 1 \u2013 3 must be submitted electronically to Turnitin via Canvas by 10 AM on their\nrespective due date. (Please note there will be no assignment box in the Assignment Centre\non the due date)\nYour final report must be submitted electronically to Canvas and a hard copy is handed inclass on Tuesday 6 June.\nPrinting and binding your final report\nPrint your final report double-sided. Although not strictly enforced, to give your final report\na finished professional appearance, you are advised to print it in full colour and spiralbound.\nChapter peer review\nYou need to complete a peer review which involves you reviewing the chapters completed\nby students in the class. In addition, as one of the authors you will be receiving feedback\nfrom your peers and you will be responding to your peer reviews explaining how you\naddressed their comments in your final submission. The peer review will begin after\nChapter 1 submission and will use Turnitin (accessed via Canvas). The peer review\ncontributes 20% to your final grade (10% for peer review and 10% for your response to\nreviewers). Your chapters need to be submitted to Turnitin by 10 AM on the day the\nChapters are due. The system will then randomly assign three files for you to peer review.\nThe review is double-blinded, i.e. the reviewer does not know the author and the author\ndoes not know the reviewer (ensure that chapters submitted to Turnitin cannot be linked\nto you). Your review is due before 10 AM on the days when peer review submission is due.\n\n\fTo complete the peer review feedback loop, after you receive feedback on your own\nsubmission (you should have received three reports), you need to respond to your\nreviewers. In your response you need to identify how you addressed their comments and\nwhat changes you have made as a result and what feedback you decided to ignore. The\nauthors\u2019 (students) responses to reviewers must be submitted with the final report.\nLate assignments\nIf either the hard or soft copies are submitted late then the entire assignment is considered\nto be late and you will lose marks as per the department\u2019s policy on \u2018handing in\nassignments and granting extensions\u2019:\nAssignments handed in up to 3 teaching days (or weekdays during a mid\nsemester break or study/exam period) late will automatically lose 20% of the\ntotal marks possible. Assignments handed in more than 3 days late and up to\none week late will automatically lose 50% of the total marks possible.\nAssignments handed in more than one week after the specified hand-in date\nand time will receive no marks.\nINCLUSIVE LEARNING\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the course lecturer.\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK\nYou will have an opportunity to complete a formative mid-course evaluation. I encourage\neveryone to take time and provide feedback on the course so we can continually improve\nthe quality of the course.\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via Canvas and the university web site.\nDepartmental policies:\nPlease read through the Department of Property Policies on the department\u2019s website\nunder Department Home > Study Options > Study policies and guidelines.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may\nbe reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\nmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an\nelectronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to\navoid plagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat, and\nviews cheating in coursework as a serious academic offence. The work that a student\nsubmits for grading must be the student's own work, reflecting his or her learning. Where\nwork from other sources is used, it must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This\nrequirement also applies to sources on the world-wide web.\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to\ngive a copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs.\nReferen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/INTBUS306.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nINTBUS306: GLOBAL AND REGIONAL BUSINESS\n(15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\nCourse Prescription\n\nFocuses on the conduct of business in the world\u2019s regions.

Due 18 March at 4 pm. Peer assessment\nis your opportunity to communicate to your peers about their contribution toward the\nhands-on project. You will allocate marks across your team mates and qualitative feedback\nto help them understand your judgement of their performance. It is important that you\nraise the evaluation of people who worked hard for the good of the team and lower the\nevaluation of those you perceived not to be working as hard. Those who contributed should\nreceive the full worth of the final project grade; those who did not contribute fully should\nonly receive partial credit. The quantitative feedback for each group member will be\ncollated and used to calculate an individual peer assessment mark. The peer evaluation\nmark is multiplied with the mark the group received for the final report. More instructions\nwill be communicated via CANVAS closer to the date.\nNote: It is your responsibility to other members of your team to provide feedback to them\nbecause they also take the time and care to evaluate your contribution. Timely and\n\n\fthoughtful participation in the peer review process is an element of your individual\nperformance and contribution to the team\u2019s collective effort. So, in short, you must\ncomplete the peer assessment on time to be awarded any grades for this assessment\ncomponent. If you fail to complete the peer assessment by the due date, you will be\nawarded zero marks for this component.\n\nGrade Criteria\nGrade\nA+\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\nC\nC\nCD+\nD\nD-\n\n%\n90-100\n85-89\n80-84\n75-79\n70-74\n65-69\n60-64\n55-59\n55-59\n50-54\n45-49\n40-44\n0-39\n\nPlagiarism\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating.

To manage an organisation effectively with quality as the driving\nforce and to develop appropriate business strategies, an understanding of TQM\nphilosophy, systems, tools and practices is required.\nTQM is a company-wide quality activity. It involves the entire organisation, as\ndeficiencies in one department affect the functioning of another. A crossfunctional perspective is therefore called for. This is an understanding emanating\nfrom what is called Systems Thinking. For implementing TQM in an organisation\nrun in the 'old' way, effective management of change is essential. This requires\ncommitment from the top, involvement at all levels, customer focus, process\norientation, continuous improvement, elimination of waste, fool-proofing, sharing\ninformation, partnership with suppliers, and the extraordinary wisdom to listen to\nboth the voice of the customers (both internal and external) and the processes.\nTQM aims to foster a cross-functional spirit in an organisation. No more there is\nrivalry between sales and production, production and inspection, but there is a\nsingle entity, a team.\nTo bring about such a cultural change in an organisation it is impossible without\ncommitment and constancy of purpose. The goal of this course is to prepare the\nstudents to be such change agents.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course it is expected that a student will be able to:\n1.\n\nunderstand the role of quality in a business strategy;\n\n\f2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nacquire a basic knowledge of systems thinking for quality;\nunderstand that the essence of organisational health, is people;\nunderstand the need for innovation and continuous improvement;\nacquire skills in using statistical thinking in management processes; and\nlearn how organisational quality achievements are evaluated against quality\nawards criteria.\n\nContent Outline\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nTotal Quality Management and Systems Thinking\nTotal Quality, Philosophies\nFocusing on Customer\nLeadership & Strategic Planning\nContinuous Improvement Tools\nStatistical Thinking and applications\nProcess Management\nPrinciples of Six Sigma.

The in-class test gauges your ability to communicate your newly acquired\nknowledge in writing. The assignment engages your interest to learn about critical themes\nin international business. The final class test covers all topics addressed in the plenary\nlectures, class discussions and readings.\nWeekly online quizzes (8%)\nEight quizzes cover the weekly assigned textbook chapters (2% x 8 = 16%). Quizzes are\ncompleted through Canvas. An unmarked trial quiz will be provided in the tutorial session\nin the first week to show you how to do the quizzes using Canvas.\nMid-term Test (20%)\nForty minute in-class test, comprised of short answer questions. Covers materials in the\nfirst five weeks of the quarter.\nTBL Group Presentation (8%)\nA group presentation in Week 8, receiving a grade of 8%. This is the last of a series of\ngroup exercises completed in the 2-hour TBL sessions on Fridays (1-3pm). Only the last of\nthese is awarded a grade, once students have experience with the format. In these sessions\nstudents research and prepare a short presentation for the class, based on the week\u2019s\ntheme. The topics usually involve scrutiny of contemporary issues.\nIndividual Assignment (24%)\nAn individual assignment, due in Week 7, will enable you to demonstrate your\nunderstanding\n\nof\n\nconcepts\n\nin\n\nthe\n\ninternational\n\nbusiness\n\nenvironment.\n\nBusiness\n\nCommunication Team Seminars will address essay structure and writing style. Librarians\ncan assist in locating sources. Further guidance will be given in class.\nFinal Test (40%)\nLearning outcomes are assessed in a final test that covers all topics addressed in the plenary\nlectures, class discussions and readings. A timed mock test is held in the Week 9 TBL to\nhelp students prepare for the final secured test.\n\nLearning\nOutcome\n1\n\nQuizzes\n\nGroup\nPresentation\n\nIn-class test\n\nAssignment\n\nFinal Test\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n2\n3\n\nx\n\n4\n\nx\n\nEnd of Course Outline \u2013 Syllabus Continues on next page\n\n\fWeek\n1\n27 March\n2\n3 April\n3\n10 April\n4\n17 April\n\n5\n24 April\n6\n1 May\n\nTopics and Compulsory Readings\n\nNotes\n\nQuiz\nDeadlines\n\nIntroduction to the Course;\nThe Multinational Enterprise\n\nChapter 1\n15 April\n9am\n\nGlobalisation and the International\nSystem\n\nChapter 2\n\nCultural and Social Environments\n\nChapter 3\n\nNo TBL session\n14 April Good Friday\n\n22 April\n9am\n\nChapter 4\n\n17 April Easter Monday\nLecture in TBL\n\n29 April\n9am\n\nChapter 5\n\nMid-term test\n\nThe Economic Environment\n\n6 May 9am\nThe Political Environment\n\nThe Legal Environment\n\n13 May\n9am\n\nChapter 6\n\n7\n8 May\n\nInternational Trade and Protectionism\n\nChapter 7\n\n8\n15 May\n\nEcology and Climate Change\n\nChapter 10\n\nIndividual assignment\ndue\nMarked TBL group\npresentation\n\n9\n22 May\n\nEthics in an international context\n\nChapter 11\n\nTBL covers past final\nquestions\n\n10\n29 May\n\nReview\n\nFinal Test\n\n20 May\n9am\n26 May\n9am\n3 June\n9am\n\n\fInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the course director/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat, and views\ncheating in coursework as a serious academic offence. The work that a student submits for\ngrading must be the student's own work, reflecting his or her learning. Where work from\nother sources is used, it must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This requirement\nalso applies to sources on the world-wide web. A student's assessed work .may be reviewed\nagainst electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon\nreasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of their work\nfor computerised review.\n\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions, the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every effort\nto provide you with up-to-date information via Canvas and the university website.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MKTG303.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nMKTG 303: BUYER BEHAVIOUR (15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCourse Prescription\n\nEssentially, the application of psychology to how people make consumption decisions and\ninterpret advertising.

Your grade will be based on four main criteria:\n1) your ability to briefly discuss the relevant theories (30%):\n\u2022\n\nyou must show that you understand the theories, how they work, and how they\ninfluence consumer behaviour.\n\n2) your ability to effectively illustrate theories with marketing examples of the motivations\nlisted (20%)\n\u2022\n\nyou have to then take the theory one step further to show specifically how it applies\nto the consumer behaviour issues using relevant examples.\n\n3) your ability to integrate other relevant theories (20%):\n\u2022\n\nwhile there is a specific topic given for this essay, you need to show that you have\nconsidered how other theories and materials that we covered in the class may be\nrelevant for this topic.\n\n4) the clarity and effectiveness of your communication (30%):\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nin this respect, writing style does matter because it is part of effective communication\nthe key is to convey your point simply and clearly (BIG WORDS do not impress, but\nclarity does).\nReferencing IS crucial, both within the body of your essay and a reference list at the end\n\nImportant: This assignment is in two parts. Please hand in one assignment. I have written it\nas two parts merely to make clear what is required. It will be graded as one assignment.\nPlease submit to turnitin in addition to submitting a hard copy. You will not receive a\ngrade if you do not submit to turnitin\n\n\fPart one: Essay and Discussion of Advertisements\nIn order to stimulate involvement, marketers often try to target consumers by appealing to one\nof a series of common motives e.g. identification, self-expression, achievement, affiliation, and\nself-esteem (chapter 10 of your text book Quester, Pettigrew, Kopanidis, Rao Hill. (2014).\nConsumer Behaviour: Implications for marketing strategy (7th edition). Australia: McGrawHill Education).\nWrite an essay discussing how needs and motivations are interrelated concepts and why they\nare important concepts for marketers to understand. Illustrate your points by providing\nmarketing examples for each of these five motives (identification, self-expression,\nachievement, affiliation and self-esteem).\nAlthough this is an essay on needs and motivations, I will expect your knowledge of other\nconsumer behaviour theories (e.g. self, attitudes, learning, memory, involvement etc) to inform\nyour answer.\n\nPart two: Designing an ad\nDesign an advertisement for any product (or brand or service or charity or social cause) that\nyou are familiar with that emphasises one of these motives - identification, self-expression,\nachievement, affiliation, or self-esteem. You can create your own product or brand if you wish\nto do so. Your advertisement must communicate the motive you have chosen clearly, either\nthrough visual or verbal cues, or both. Write a brief paragraph discussing why you think that\nthis motive is most appropriate for the product, and why the other motives are not so\nappropriate.\nPlease note the following:\n1. Make sure that you start as soon as possible.\n2. Computer problems (eg, \u201cthe computer ate my memory stick,\u201d \u201cthe printer wouldn\u2019t\nprint\u201d, \u201cI was getting it ready the night before and the computer crashed\u201d \u201cthe dog ate\nmy memory stick\u201d) are not deemed to warrant extensions. You should regularly backup\nfiles of your work. Also, keep hard copies. The assignment topic is provided to you\nat the beginning of the semester to allow you plenty of time to plan ahead.\n3. Use APA referencing rather than endnotes and footnotes. Suitable referencing\n(i.e, the APA or Harvard style) will be expected. If you are unsure, articles in journals\nsuch as the Journal of Consumer Research, and Journal of Marketing Research use this\nstyle. So if you are referencing the text, you write \u201c(Solomon, 1999)\u201d in the text of\nyour assignment.\n4. We expect a minimum of 5 references in your essay. At least 3 need to be journal\narticles.\n5. The written part of the assignment must NOT exceed 5 pages (excluding references\netc.). Assignments should be typed, 1\u00bd spaced, with at least 2.5cm wide margins on\nboth sides, font size 12.\n6. All assignments must be submitted in hard copy with the Department of Marketing\nCover Page (available at the Commerce Student Resource Centre) and stapled at the\nleft-hand corner. Please take care to ensure that your ads are securely fixed to your\nessay. NO electronic copies of your assignment or ads will be accepted.\n\n\f7. We take plagiarism very seriously; make sure to reference your sources\nappropriately. We will be using Turnitin.\n8. This assignment is worth 30% of the total coursework, and is assessed using a letter\ngrade as follows (from the undergraduate protocol):\n9. Your ad must be original \u2013 do NOT copy an ad that is already out there\n10. Once you have received your grade you have two weeks in which to request further\nfeedback or for your assignment to be re-graded.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MARKETING UNDERGRADUATE PROTOCOL\nWe, the Marketing Department, regard our relationship with students as very important.\nThis is why we have written this protocol which describes the key policies and practices\nthat will help you to have a clear understanding of what you can expect from your\nlecturer and what the lecturer can expect from you. In respect to this, our overriding\nprinciples are consistency and fairness in terms of how each student is treated.\nCommunication\nCourse-Coordinators, Lecturers and Tutors will always aim to communicate with you in a\ntimely and efficient manner. The main venue where the course information will be\nprovided are lectures and tutorials. Additionally, the main information related to the\ncourse, such as deadlines for your assignments, can be found in the Course Outline.\nSome Course Outlines may be provided electronically while others are available in\nhardcopy.\nWe also use Canvas to help students keep track of their own progress, e.g. allowing\nstudents to check their own marks on the web. Some marketing lecturers may also use\nCanvas to:\n\u25baProvide students with unrestricted access to course materials (lecture notes, case\nstudies and reference materials). Students will be able to access these materials anytime\nand anywhere via the Internet.\n\u25baKeep students informed with changes to the schedule, upcoming events, and\nopportunities for part time marketing jobs or social events.\nPlease note that the information posted on Cecil does not fully cover information given in\nlectures. Therefore, if you miss a class, you should ask other students whether you have\nmissed any important announcements (or materials). It is your responsibility to monitor,\nread, and keep up to date on all course communications.\nThe email address you have listed in Cecil must be one that you use and check most\nfrequently. This is the address to which your course lecturers will send any important\nmessages and updates. Your current mailing address and other contact details must\nalways be kept up to date on Student Services Online, the University\u2019s online enrolment\nand student administration system. You can update your personal details by logging on\nto Student Services Online and then clicking on \u201cUpdate your details\u201d.\n\n\fGrading\nThis is the distribution that students are graded on for undergraduate courses in the\nDepartment of Marketing:\nGRADE\nA+\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\nC\nCD+\nD\nD-\n\nDESCRIPTION\nOutstanding\nExcellent\nApproaching Excellence\nVery good, comfortably meeting expectations\nGood, meets expectations\nGood, just meets expectations but minor problems\nAdequate, almost meeting expectations but minor problems\nAdequate, not quite meeting expectations because of problems\nJust adequate, not quite meeting expectations because of further\nproblems\nInadequate, further problems and below expectations\nInadequate, well below expectations because of major problems\nCompletely inadequate, well below expectations because of major\nproblems\n\n%\n90-100\n85-89\n80-84\n75-79\n70-74\n65-69\n60-64\n55-59\n50-54\n45-49\n40-44\n0-39\n\nPlease note: The grade scales are indicative only. Scaling may be applied.\nAssignments\nPlease note that group and individual assignment weightings can NOT be transferred to\nthe final exam/assessment.\nWhen handing in your assignments, please use the appropriate cover sheet, and please\nuse your official name, as is currently used in University records. You will have considerable\nadvance notice about the date that assignments are due. Therefore, you must plan your\nwork to give yourself leeway so unforeseen events such as computer problems or losing\nan assignment do not prevent you from handing the assignment in on time. Unacceptable\nreasons for a late assignment also include being overseas or other work or sporting\ncommitments. Acceptable reasons for handing a late assignment might be a longer period\nof illness prior to the deadline, unexpected incarceration or bereavement. However, in\nthese circumstances you will be required to provide suitable documentation as evidence\n(e.g. a certificate from the campus Health Centre), as early as possible, but no later than\nthe assignment due date.\nStudents will be penalised for handing in assignments after the due date. Below is a list of\npenalties that can be expected:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nday late 10% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 20% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 30% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 40% off grade achieved by student\ndays late 50% off grade achieved by student\n\nNote: Assignments handed in five minutes past the deadline are considered one day late.\nIf an assignment is due in on a Friday, then an assignment submitted on Monday is\nconsidered to be three days late. Assignments handed in later than five days after the\ndeadline will not be graded. Although these penalties may seem harsh, their purpose is to\nprepare you for the expectations your employer will have of you (i.e. planning your time\nefficiently, and meeting deadlines) while maintaining fair and equitable treatment of all\nstudents.\nFor group assignments, all members of the group will be awarded the same group\nassignment mark, unless the course coordinator is informed of group issues that may have\n\n\fadversely affected the group work. Such issues must be brought to the attention of the\ncourse co-ordinator before the assignment due date.\nIn group assignments where peer assessment is used, students not contributing equally to\nthe group effort may be penalised. Therefore students should inform their team mates,\nand the teaching staff, if they are unable to contribute equitably to the group assignment\nat any point. Once again, suitable documentation must be given to the course co-ordinator\nas early as possible, but no later than the assignment due date.\nGrading of Assessments\nStudents can expect all mid-semester tests and assignments to be graded and returned in\ntutorials within two weeks (unless otherwise specified by lecturer). Your grades will be\nviewable on Canvas as soon as they are available. Always remember to compare your\ngrades on Canvas with the grades that are written on your test or assignments, and report\nany discrepancies to your lecturer or tutor without delay.\nImportance of Mid-Semester Tests and the Final Exam\nMid-semester tests provide an opportunity for students to test their individual knowledge\nunder controlled conditions, and also allow students to practice for the final exam. The final\nexam is an integral part of each paper and accounts for a large percentage of your final\ngrade. Failing the final exam may make it very difficult to pass a paper.\nIt is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of the location, time, and date of their midsemester tests and final exams. Students who miss mid-semester tests or final exams\nbecause of ill health or bereavement reasons may apply for an aegrotat or for\ncompassionate consideration (see the University Calendar/Examination Regulations for the\nrelevant procedures). Be aware that you have to apply within 7 days after the test/exam.\nLinks to the Exam and AEGROTAT/COMPASSIONATE information page:\n\u2022 http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/cs-examination-information\n\u2022 http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/cs-aegrotat-and-compassionateconsideration\nNote: Acceptable reasons for missing tests/exams include documented illness of yourself\nor your dependent(s), incarceration and bereavement. Reasons such as going on vacation,\nsporting or work commitments, or getting the date and/or time of test wrong etc. are not\nacceptable. If you are disabled or have other difficulties necessitating special\naccommodation for the test/exam (e.g. a longer test time, or a separate testing room),\nplease advise the Course Coordinator as soon as possible.\nClass Representatives\nThe Marketing Department values the role of class representatives and encourages\nstudents to act in this capacity. Students are encouraged to talk to class representatives\nabout the course. Lecturers really appreciate the class representatives\u2019 feedback.

Room code: Library CTR, 402-208. All other TBL\nsessions will take place in room 215 in the Business School.\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThe class will meet for 5.5 hours each week: 1.5 hours for the plenary lecture, 2 hours\nfor the tutorial, and 2 hours for the TBL. The lecturer will use the plenary session to engage\nthe class in a discussion of the important concepts for the week, based on the required\nreadings. Students should come to class having already read the readings in order to\nparticipate in the plenary discussions. The tutorial session will clarify the concepts and use\nshort activities and problems to explore them in greater depth in preparation for the TBL\nsession. The TBL session will focus on group activities which apply the concepts to cases\nstudies and real-world problems in order to fortify students' understanding through applied\nlearning. However, the TBL session may also be used to introduce new material and this\nwill include an opportunity to work through problem questions related to the topic.\nIn addition to attending classes, students should expect to spend another ten hours per\nweek on activities related to this course. These activities include carrying out the required\nreadings (before the plenary session), solving recommended practice problems, working\non assignments, taking quizzes on Canvas and preparing for tests. It is of the utmost\nimportance that students dedicate the allocated time to self-study. In terns of reading\nthere is often more reading in the early weeks of the course and this allows more time for\nassignment and test preparation as the courses progresses.\nTeaching Staff\nLecturer: Huigenia Ostik\nEmail:h.ostik@auckland.ac.nz\nOffice hours: Monday 10 am \u2013 12 pm in room 674.\nTutor: Christina Zhu\nEmail:christina.zhu@auckland.ac.nz\nOffice hours: Wednesday 11 am \u2013 1pm in room 233.\n***Before attending office hours you are advised to check the announcements\npage on Canvas to see if office hours - for either Huigenia or Christina - have\nchanged time or location***\nLearning Resources\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nRequired textbook: S.

Essential reading for all topics is\ncontained within this booklet. The following will be made available on Canvas during the\ncourse:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nlecture slides and recordings (where possible) after the lecture has been delivered\ntutorial questions a week in advance of the relevant\nteam-based learning exercises (availability will vary according to the nature of the\nsession)\nadditional reading material if relevant\n\nThere will be a one and a half hour lecture each week on Mondays starting at 12.00. The\nlectures will be covering the material that will then be tested more thoroughly during the\ntutorials, attendance at which is compulsory. The questions for the tutorials will be\nmade available on Canvas one week before the relevant tutorial. Students will be expected\nto prepare in advance for the tutorials and participate in tutorials. There will be one\ntutorial session: 9.00 \u2013 11.00 on Wednesdays from Weeks One to Ten.\nPreparing for lectures and tutorials well in advance will help you to follow and understand\nthe course topic and will hopefully prompt you to ask more forensic questions of the\nlecturer.\nThe team-based learning (TBL) sessions will seek to bring together the knowledge you\nhave acquired during the lectures and tutorials in a practical way. Note that there is a lot\nof content to cover, so there may not be TBL sessions every week. This means that some\nTBL sessions may involve the introduction of new material and the opportunity to then\nwork through this new material in groups.\nFurther reading materials are recommended reading for those who are interested. This\nmaterial has been selected to help students contextualise and deepen the knowledge that\nthey are expected to acquire during the course. Most, but not all, of this material will be\nprovided on Canvas under \"Reading Lists\".\n\n\fStudent Feedback\nWe regularly seek feedback from students in order to shape and improve this and all\ncourses on the programme. Students will be asked to complete formative fast feedback\nearly in the quarter, and course and teaching evaluations at the end of the course. In\naddition, each course will seek volunteers to serve as class reps.\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via Canvas and the university web site.\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating.

The course seeks to give you an appreciation of what financial\nmanagement is and why the role is important. Good financial analysis is necessary (but\nof course not sufficient). After the course you should feel better able to engage with the\nfinancial manager \u2013 you should also be more financially literate.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that you will be able to:\n1. Appreciate the rationale underlying the objective of the organisation from the\nperspective of finance. In \u201cprofit seeking\u201d organisations this is normally value\nmaximisation.\n2. Understand the theoretical approaches to the valuation of real and financial assets,\nand be able to assess their implementation in practice.\n3.

Sessions will typically comprise a\nmixture of a formal lecture component, general discussions, and problem-solving.\nSessions one and two will focus on mastering some of the key concepts in finance. An\nindividual assignment will be set to measure students\u2019 mastery of this material. The\nsubsequent sessions will build on this foundation.\n\nTeaching Staff\nAssociate Professor Alastair Marsden\nDepartment of Accounting and Finance\nPhone: 373 7599 ext 88564\nEmail: a.marsden@auckland.ac.nz\nOffice: Room 5105, Level 5 OGGB\nOffice Hours: By arrangement.\nKaris Wang, Tutor\nDepartment of Accounting and Finance\nPhone: 9235443\nEmail: karis.wang@auckland.ac.nz\nOffice: Room 579, Level 5 OGGB\nOffice Hours: By arrangement.\n\n1\n\nBM&M - Brealey, Myers, and Marcus \u2013 see below in Learning Resources.\n\n\fTutorial sessions will be advised in class.\n\nLearning Resources\nThe required textbook for this course is: Brealey, Myers, and Marcus, Fundamentals of\nCorporate Finance (8th Edition, 2015).

This qualitative data, which is administered, collected and collated by the\nProgramme Office, is designed as an \u2018early warning\u2019 system of any significant issues with\nthe course that might need addressing quickly.\nLecturers are asked to provide a brief report to the Director GSM MBA on key items\nidentified and proposed actions. Lecturers are also asked to provide a verbal report to\nthe class, proposing any solutions as appropriate.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nThe University of Auckland evaluates the quality of teaching and of courses by using the\nthe Summative Evaluation Tool, or SET. Summative evaluation is formal, summative\nevaluation of teaching undertaken according to University policy and is conducted at the\nend of a semester/quarter through the use of the formal University SET instruments.\nSummative evaluation is used by teachers to reflect on their teaching practice, and is\nalso used by the University for quality assurance of teaching and courses.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\nCHEATING AND PLAGIARISM\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may\nbe reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\nmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an\nelectronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for\nfurther information about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\n\n\fThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to\navoid plagiarism.

Examines the challenges that managers and leaders face in managing people\nand organisations.\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe course introduces students to the theory and practice of management, within a\nmultidisciplinary business simulation. The emphasis is on understanding the people\nmanagement issues students are likely to encounter in an organisational context in the\npursuit of sustained individual, team and organisational performance.\n\nIn particular, the course challenges students to:\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nunderstand relevant theories of management, and apply these in practice;\ngain an appreciation of the complexity of managing people in organisations;\ndevelop reflective skills that integrate theory and management action; and\nuse theory as an analytical tool to make sense of complex organisational problems.\n\nThis course is designed to familiarise students with the role of a manager with the aim of\nenabling graduates to perform effectively when they join the workforce as manager or\nemployee. The course is designed to build the interpersonal and communication skills\nstudents will need to operate in high-pressure, competitive environments. The course will\ndevelop the capabilities that junior managers need to succeed in diverse workplace teams\nand within international contexts.\n\nA primary element of the course is a business simulation called \u2018MikesBikes.\u2019 This is an\nadvanced, integrated, multi-disciplinary simulation wherein students make design (R&D),\nmarketing, finance, operations and human resource decisions in virtual bicycle companies,\nin competition with other student-led teams. Company performance, e.g., total\nshareholder value, is reported weekly and most student assessments revolve around the\nsimulation.\n\n\fLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nanalyse individual and team behaviours from one or more theoretical perspectives;\napply multiple perspectives when analysing management problems;\ncritically review literature pertaining to managing people in organisations;\nwork effectively in inter-disciplinary teams;\ndemonstrate skills in self-management and reflection; and\napply professional written and oral communication skills.\n\nContent Outline\nWeek 1\n\nIntroduction \u2013 What is management?

By utilising frameworks and tools and\nthinking critically and creatively, operations can solve practical problems and generate\ninnovative ideas to establish valuable organizational capabilities (including those providing\nsustainable competitive advantage) that are aligned with business strategy, and integrated\nwith marketing, people, information systems, and finance.\nA variety of instructional methods will be employed, including lecture, case discussion,\nworked examples, simulations, and video (some for a \u201cflipped classroom\u201d).

There are four cases in the course representing a variety of\nindustries and geographical focus.\nIt is essential to have read and reflected on the prescribed material before each session\nto ensure class discussion is well informed and productive.\nStudent feedback will be sought throughout the course \u2013 informally, via evaluation, and\nstudent representatives. We also welcome questions you may have after any session.\nWhere appropriate we will answer these for the whole class in a subsequent session, and\nthe best ones will be recognized as a contribution to the class discussion.\nI endeavour to provide feedback on all submissions/tests within one week at the most.\nThis feedback should prove helpful for subsequent assessment. I am happy to correspond\nvia e-mail, phone, skype or in person.\n\n2\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\nTeaching Staff\n\nDavid Robb\nTitle:\nProfessor of Operations and Supply Chain Management\nPhone:\n09-923-2812\nOffice:\n260-346 (overlooks Grafton Road)\nOffice Hours: by appointment\nEmail:\nd.robb@auckland.ac.nz\nShandong Mou\nTitle:\nGraduate Teaching Assistant\nOffice Hours: Tuesdays, 4:00-5:15pm in 260-3116\nEmail:\ns.mou@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\n\nThe following text is optional: Cachon, G., and Terwiesch, C.

Setting the Reorder Point using Business Intelligence\n\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\n\n6\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\nINCLUSIVE LEARNING\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face- toface and/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK\nFormative feedback surveys\nDuring the early part of the quarter (usually Week 3 or 4), short feedback surveys are\nadministered to all students to get a snapshot of how they are coping with their new\ncourses. This qualitative data, which is administered, collected and collated by the\nProgramme Office, is designed as an \u2018early warning\u2019 system of any significant issues with\nthe course that might need addressing quickly.\nLecturers are asked to provide a brief report to the Director GSM MBA on key items\nidentified and proposed actions. Lecturers are also asked to provide a verbal report to\nthe class, proposing any solutions as appropriate.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nThe University of Auckland evaluates the quality of teaching and of courses by using the\nthe Summative Evaluation Tool, or SET. Summative evaluation is formal, summative\nevaluation of teaching undertaken according to University policy and is conducted at the\nend of a semester/quarter through the use of the formal University SET instruments.\nSummative evaluation is used by teachers to reflect on their teaching practice, and is\nalso used by the University for quality assurance of teaching and courses.\n\n7\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\n8\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSMGT722.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nBUSMGT 722: Innovation and Value Creation (15 POINTS)\nQuarter 1 (1172)\nCourse Prescription\nFocuses on how entrepreneurs and organisations create and capture value through\ninnovation.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\n\nBJ\n\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\n\nSU\n\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\n\n\fincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\n\nE\n\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\n\nAN\n\nHelp with Academic Referencing\n\nG\n\nA copy of the guidelines is available\nat: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nH\n\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\nC\n\nAssignment Submission\n\nTO\n\nAll assignments for this course should be submitted through the Assignments section of\nthese course webpages, after going through the standard review process.

There will be ten 3-hour seminars held\non a weekly basis. Attendance at each seminar is compulsory.\nThis course is based on seminar presentations. Students will lead the seminars. Each\nstudent will be assigned to a research article and will have to make a presentation where\nthey review it (see Assessment below). However, students are required to read all\narticles whether presenting or not. Non-presenting students will be expected to ask and\nanswer questions and to participate in all discussions. Participation will be assessed.\n\n\fTeaching Staff\nDr. Lily Chen\nOffice: OGGB 565\nTel: 923-7484\nEmail: li.chen@auckland.ac.nz\nOffice: 565 Owen G Glenn Building, extn 87484; office hours \u2013 Fridays, 2-4pm or by\nappointment\nLearning Resources\nAll readings will be available on-line.\nAssessment\nThe final grade will determined as follows:\nSeminar presentation1\nClass participation2\nProject3\nFinal examination4\n\n10%\n20%\n20%\n50%\n100%\n\nEach student will present one paper during the semester. The paper will be\npresented individually or as a team. Each presentation should last between 25-30\nminutes. In the presentation, the individual or team should provide an overview of the\nstudy. Each team should discuss the:\n1/\nResearch question,\n2/\nMotivation and contribution,\n3/\nLiterature review,\n4/\nConceptual model and hypotheses,\n5/\nResearch design including the sample, variables, and methods of analysis,\n6/\nResults, and\n7/\nConclusion.\n1\n\nThe presentation will be assessed on the content (scope and depth of coverage of the\nitems listed above), explanation (ability to clearly explain the material), and presentation\n(organisation, visual aids, communication skills, time management). A \u2018good\u2019\npresentation is one where the presenter explains the paper in his/her own words and\nadds value by helping the class to better understand the study. A presentation that\ninvolves re-reading substantial parts of the assigned article will receive low marks. Slides\nthat are creative both in terms of what information is presented and how it is shown\n(e.g., how much on each slide, use of diagrams or figures) are an integral part of a\n\u2018good\u2019 presentation.\nPresentations that exceed 30 minutes will be penalized. As it is unlikely that you will be\nable to cover every aspect of the paper in 30 minutes, you will need to decide on which\npoints to emphasize. Presentation slides should be emailed to Dr Lily Chen by 5pm on\nthe day prior to your presentation. Presenters should bring sufficient copies to distribute\nto the class.\nClass participation will be based on the quality and quantity of the student\u2019s\nverbal interactions. Students should be able to participate in general discussions, e.g.,\nasking/answering questions, discussing the paper\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\nAttendance at the seminars is compulsory and will not be considered in evaluating class\nparticipation.\n2\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nInformation about the project will be distributed in April.\n\nLearning\nOutcome\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nPresentation\nX\nX\nX\n\nParticipation\nX\nX\nX\n\nProject\n\nExam\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face- toface and/or in written form with the Course Director.\nStudent Feedback\nStudents should feel free to discuss any aspect of the course with Dr Lily Chen at any\ntime.\n\n3\n\n\fReadings and Seminar Schedule (Note: this is preliminary and may be subject\nto change)\n\nSeminar 1\nTopic: Disclosure\nBartov, E., Mohanram, P. 2014.

The course covers the test of\nresidence for individuals and corporates, and the wider tax base for off-shore income of New\nZealand residents. It also covers the taxation of income derived by overseas residents from\nNew Zealand activities and the application of the Double Tax Conventions to various sources\nof income and transactions. The course also addresses the selecting of country of residence in\nthe form of treaty shopping, anti-avoidance measures directed at transaction activity and the\nuse of tax havens.\nGoals of the Course\nThe paper is an advanced course studying New Zealand\u2019s international tax regime. The\nobjectives of the course are to provide students with both a theoretical background and high\nlevel of technical knowledge of the scope and application of the most significant aspects of\ninbound and outbound investment under the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Double Tax\nAgreements. Where appropriate, a comparison is made with the international regimes of our\nmajor trading partners, in order to provide a deeper understanding of the policy behind New\nZealand\u2019s international tax regime.\nThe course provides students with an opportunity to increase their research, writing and group\npresentation skills by the completion of one major seminar paper on a topic chosen by each\nstudent, which is presented to the class. The final exam requires students to apply all aspects\nof the international tax regime they have mastered during the course. Emphasis is therefore\nplaced on good analytical skills and presentation of researched, comprehensive and well\nreasoned solutions.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents who take and pass this course will be able to:\n1. Identify and comprehend the major aspects of the international tax regime in the\nIncome Tax Act 2007\n2. Analyse the policies and principles underlying those regimes\n3. Appraise and analyse between the different tax treatment of comparable structures\nand types of income and expenditure\n4. Analyse and evaluate the application of the international tax regimes to business\ntransactions for the purposes of providing advice or administering the tax system\n\n\f5.

In preparation of their papers, students will be expected to be able to make use of the\nappropriate library and internet resources, including but not limited to:\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand, United Kingdom, Australian and other case law;\n\n\uf0b7\n\nAcademic journals (held in the Auckland University collections or on Lexis/\nNexis);\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand Government materials, including:\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\nAll published New Zealand IRD material\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand Government Discussion Documents\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand Consultative Committee Documents\n\n\uf0b7\n\nStatutory material both current and historical.\n\nTax treaties.\n\n\fThere are a variety of on-line resources available that will assist students in this course. Davis\nLaw Library staff are available to assist students in accessing all on-line materials available.\nA course book will be distributed to students prior to the course. Please endeavour to have\nread as much as you can.\nAssessment\nThe final grade for the course is made up by the following:\nSeminar Paper (including 10% for presentation)\nAttendance and Participation in seminars\nFinal Take-home Exam\n\n50%\n10%\n40%\n\nDue to the technical nature of the Income Tax Act 2007, the course assessments test research\nand analytical skills. Each piece of written work requires students to demonstrate knowledge\nof a number of different regimes of the Act, thereby testing their depth of knowledge and\nunderstanding of the underlying policy.\nPlusage does not apply.\nPlease refer to the Postgraduate Guide 2014 for further information.\n\nSeminars:\nStudents must complete one seminar paper worth 50% each of the final mark. The grade for\nthis seminar has two components, covering both the written paper and the quality of its\npresentation.\n40% of the grade for the seminar is based upon a seminar paper of approximately 7,000\nwords. 10% of the grade is based upon the presentation of the seminar paper by the student\nto the class in Part B of the course. The mark is based upon presentation skills, interest\ngenerated among the class and ability to communicate the topic clearly. The seminar and\npresentation grades are separately assessed (meaning an excellent paper may be presented\nbadly or a poor paper may be presented well \u2013 and the separate marks will reflect those\ndifferences).\nStudents must select their seminar topics from the list provided below.\nStudents must hand in their seminar paper to the Department on Friday 17th of October 2014\n(i.e. a fortnight prior to the date of presentation in Part B). Copies of the papers will be\ndistributed to all students before Part B commences.\nSeminar papers have a maximum limit of 7,000 words, which is to be strictly observed.\nStudents struggling to contain themselves within the word limits should discuss their paper\nwith Professor Elliffe at an early stage.\nPapers are expected to be well researched and considered works, which set out clearly their\nintended scope and deal with the subject in a well-structured fashion. Perspectives on a topic\nmay be gained from a historical or comparative analysis, or from insights provided by other\ndisciplines, eg accounting or economics. Their presentation should be of a high standard,\nsimilar to that required for submission to an academic journal. Case, text and journal citations\nshould be in the format prescribed by the New Zealand Law Style Guide. Grades will be\n\n\fawarded in accordance with the Department\u2019s policy \u201cThe Basis for Assessment of Legal\nWriting\u201d.\nAttendance and Participation\nAttendance and participation are worth 10% of the final grade. Allocating marks to class\nparticipation reflects the desire to encourage feedback and discussion within the course. As\nall seminar papers are circulated one week before presentation, all students need to have read\nand considered these papers prior to the class, and be prepared to discuss them. The small\nsize of the classes encourages interaction and student participation.\nFinal Exam\nAt the completion of the course, all students will be required to complete a take-home exam\nworth 40% of their final grade. Unlike the seminars (where topics are chosen by students) the\nfinal exam will be the same for all students and will raise a number of issues and topics\ncovered during the course. Students will have two-three weeks to complete the final exam\npaper.\nSuggested seminar topics\nStudents are expected to demonstrate a high level of knowledge regarding the application of\nthe Income Tax Act 2007 and Double Tax Agreements to their chosen seminar topic.\nStudents must be able to demonstrate an understanding of the policy and structure of the New\nZealand international tax regime.\n\uf0b7\n\nThe extraterritoriality of taxation and the inter-nation allocation of tax revenue\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe relationship between Double Tax Agreements and domestic legislation with\nrespect to the role of CFC legislation\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe relationship between Double Tax Agreements and domestic legislation with\nrespect to domestic law override\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe relationship between Double Tax Agreements and domestic legislation with\nrespect to section GB 1\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe taxation of business profits and the concept of permanent establishments\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe interpretation of Double Tax Agreements\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe history of New Zealand\u2019s taxation of foreign profits\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTreaty shopping (withholding tax and interposed entities)\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTax havens\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTransfer pricing\n\n\uf0b7\n\nHuman endeavour and tax treaties (employment and services income, pensions, etc)\n\n\f\uf0b7\n\nTransport operators (domestic regimes and tax treaties)\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNon-resident entertainers (domestic regimes and treaties) and non-resident film renters\n\n\uf0b7\n\nForeign tax credits\n\n\uf0b7\n\nControlled Foreign Companies\n\n\uf0b7\n\nForeign Investment funds\n\n\uf0b7\n\nForeign Trusts\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNon-resident insurers\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe collection of foreign taxes\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: Selected Applicants with BCom, BCom(hons), LLB, LLB(hons) or similar.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MKTG717.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nMKTG 700 (717+718): Research Ideas in Marketing (30 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCourse Prescription\nA critical precursor to the 60pt research dissertation, this course provides the ground work\nto transform students into professional researchers. Working critically with the literature and\nbeing aware of ethical implications are integral parts of any research. This course provides\nthe necessary skills related to the literature review and ethical conduct that will prepare\nstudents for carrying out their own empirical research work in marketing.\nGoals of the Course\nIn this course, you will learn how to (1) conduct a comprehensive critical literature review,\n(2) identify the gaps in extant knowledge, (3) develop research propositions to address these\ngaps, and to consider (4) the methodological and ethical implications of conducting empirical\nresearch in marketing. In doing so, you will learn how to develop your topic and to connect\nyour propositions to the academic literature, as well as to any relevant practitioner literature.\nYou will learn how to present what other researchers have already done, how to integrate and\nsynthesize different studies, to critically evaluate and articulate that research, and\ndemonstrate how the research propositions you develop can contribute to a knowledge base\nin a credible way.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents who pass this course will be able to:\n1.

Introduction \u2013 about 1000 words\n\u2022 Proposed title\n\u2022 Research question\n\u2022 Set the scene: What is the research about? Why does it interest you? Why is it\nacademically important or interesting? Is it also important or interesting to\npractitioners?\n\u2022 Background: What knowledge, if any, do you already have about the empirical\nsituation you are addressing, if you are doing empirical research?\nB. Literature Review \u2013 about 5000 words:\n\u2022 Your literature review will lay the conceptual groundwork for a potential contribution\nto that topic, by developing a relevant research question. What is original about what\nyou want to do?\n\u2022 You should construct an argument, rather than merely providing a description of the\nrelevant literature. You should argue the need for, and relevance of, your research\nquestion by setting it within the context of past research. This requires that you\ncritically evaluate and synthesise the relevant literature to demonstrate the\nsignificance and value of your study.\n\u2022 The literature review will culminate with the expression of logical hypotheses,\npropositions, and/or a conceptual framework.\nC. Discussion of conceptual framework or explanation of hypotheses. \u2013 about 1000 words\n\u2022 In this brief section you explain your reasoning behind your hypotheses and/or\nconceptual framework.\nD. Methodology \u2013 about 1500 words\n\u2022 Which research strategies and philosophies of knowledge will you draw on? What\nkind of design will be used and why?\n\u2022 Methods: what exactly will you be doing? What are the data collection methods to be\nused? What types of data should be collected? How will this be done? What could be\nthe problems of collecting these types of data? How will access be gained to\nparticipants and organisations? How many studies (interviews, surveys,\nobservations, etc.) will be conducted and why? In which ways will the methods and\ndesign answer your research questions?\n\u2022 Analysis: What, in general terms, will be done with the data you collect? What kinds\nof analytical techniques is it likely you will use? What are their limitations? How will\nthese analyses address and answer the research questions? How are you going to\nconstruct your argument, i.e., how are you going to draw together theory and data\n\n\f\u2022\n\u2022\n\nin a way that allows readers to follow you and be able to judge for themselves the\njudgements or conclusions you have reached?\nEthical considerations: Are there potential conflicts of interest, or areas of ethical\nsensitivity which may occur before, during or after the research? What cultural or\ncross-cultural issues are relevant?\nCredibility: How do you address the issues of reliability and validity or\ntrustworthiness that are relevant to your methodology?\n\nE. Planning \u2013 about 1000 words\n\u2022 Research skills: Which professional experience or research training do you already\nhave that will be relevant to this project? Which aspects of your research skills would\nyou like to improve?\n\u2022 Resources: What kind of resources, e.g., budget; equipment, etc. will you need to\ncomplete this project?\n\u2022 Timetable: Give a timetable with dates for each milestone. Include a Plan B \u2013 what\nwill you do if you cannot get the data you are planning for by the dates you have in\nmind? What alternative sources or types of data will you use?\nF. Conclusion (no more than 200 words) and References (as required)\n\u2022 A brief conclusion of your research proposal.\n\u2022 Accurate reference list of all work cited.\nAssessment criteria\nOverall, the research proposal should take the form of an academic essay and include an\nappropriate structure that demonstrates an ability to:\n\u2022 understand the theoretical aspects of research design, especially methodology\n\u2022 design a viable and realistic project.\n\u2022 argue convincingly for the academic credibility of the project.\n\u2022 understand ethical issues in research.\n\u2022 explain the relevance of all these issues to your project in your own words.\n\u2022 produce research documents to a professional academic standard.\n\u2022 write proficiently and in an interesting manner.\nIn particular, the literature review component should:\n\u2022 involve a critical evaluation of the relevant literature\n\u2022 be referenced appropriately\n\u2022 present the construction of an argument to demonstrate the relevance of your\nresearch question\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with any member of the teaching team.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MARKET713-2007.pdf", "text": "The University of Auckland Business School\nCourse Outline 2007\nMARKET 713: MARKETING FOR MANAGERS\n(20 POINTS)\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nCourse Prescription\n\nThis course outlines broad marketing concepts and the role of marketing in the\norganisation - including its relationship with other disciplines.

An\nimportant part of this explanation focuses on the role of confidence, expectations and\ncrowd psychology. These factors result in aggregate behaviour (e.g., demand in the whole\nNew Zealand economy) behaving in a different manner than would be suggested by simply\nstudying individual behaviour. Without some form of coordination, individual behaviour\ncan lead to inferior outcomes. This helps justify the need for good institutions and public\npolicy to raise welfare in nations.\nSecond, the course discusses how the right kinds of public policies and institutions can be\ndeveloped which focus the uncoordinated actions of individual households on good, rather\nthan bad, overall outcomes. In some countries, legal, political, economic and social\ninstitutions are able to coordinate private actions on stable and productive paths. Where\ninstitutional development is weak - as seems to be the case in much of the developing\nworld - private actions are poorly coordinated and the result is more macroeconomic\nvolatility and slower growth. Understanding what constitute good policies and institutions\nand how they can be designed to influence economic and business behaviour in desirable\ndirections is crucial.\nFinally, the course is intended to develop a simple framework that can be used to evaluate\nhow globalization is likely to change the performance of specific markets and thus assess\nthe associated risks, opportunities and implications for public policy.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that you will:\n1. appreciate how business, government and the global economy interact;\n2. make more informed managerial decisions by having a better understanding of\nthe genesis of booms and busts, crises caused by internal or external shocks, and\nsocial and labour unrest; and\n3. have a more coherent framework for analysing how economic policy is set by the\npublic sector to influence macroeconomic phenomena. This framework should\nenable you to enjoy a competitive advantage as a manager or business owner.\n\n\fContent Outline\n1.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments.\nA student\u2019s assessed work may be reviewed against electronic source material using\ncomputerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be\nrequired to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for\nfurther information about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to\navoid plagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via Canvas and the university web site.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/PROPERTY211.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nPROPERTY 211: PROPERTY VALUATION (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\nCourse Prescription\nAs every property is unique, the valuation of property presents many challenges and has\na strong influence on the financial viability of both existing buildings and the\ndevelopment process.\nGeneral models for valuing commercial property, industrial\nproperty and land will be introduced.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: PROPERTY 102 or ACCTG 101\nCorequisite: PROPERTY 251\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe goals of this course are to provide students with an introduction to the techniques\nemployed when preparing a commercial investment based property valuation.

Each new topic in accounting builds on the\nprevious topic, and each subsequent course in accounting assumes you understand the\nfundamentals taught in this course. The marks awarded for assignments thus should be\nseen as an additional reward for effort that should have been undertaken anyway.\nFor your tutorial, you are responsible for preparing the tutorial problems listed on\nCanvas. You will be called on to contribute to the class discussion, so prepare for\ntutorials by working through the required material. Do not come to tutorials\nunprepared, and please bring your textbook and/or the copied problems with you. Your\nsolutions to the tutorial problems will not be collected. There are 11 tutorials, the first\none beginning in week one. There is no tutorial the week of the semester test.\n\n4\n\n\fThere are ten assignments, available on Canvas, and your tutor will collect your\ncompleted assignment at the end of the applicable tutorial. Note that the first\nassignment is due at the end of the second tutorial in week two. Assignments will not be\ndiscussed in class because of time constraints; however, assignment and tutorial\nsolutions will be posted on Canvas each Friday for that week\u2019s material. Assignments will\nbe returned the following tutorial, and assignment marks will be visible at the end of the\nweek assignments are returned. Please follow the assignment rules.\nAssignment Rules:\n1)\nSolutions to the assignments must be stapled and turned in to your tutor at the\nend of your assigned tutorial.

In other words, tutors have been instructed not to\naccept assignments from students that arrive too late or at the end of tutorial just\nto turn in an assignment.\n3)\nNo late assignments will be accepted, and tutors will not mark assignments\nfrom students not in their designated tutorial.\n4)\nAssignments may be handwritten or typed. You may use pre-printed journal and\nledger forms (on Canvas).\n5)\nThere are very few excuses for missing a tutorial. These include illness, funerals,\njury duty, and university related athletics. If you have an excused absence, you\nmust contact your tutor and submit your assignment to your tutor before the\nabsence. Also, written evidence, such as a doctor\u2019s note, must be provided to your\ntutor or the assignment will not be marked.\nTutorial Preparation and Assignment Table\nWeek\nBeginning\n\nTutorial Preparation*\n\nAssignment*\n\nWorth %\n\n24 July\n\nProblems for Tutorial 1\n\n31 July\n\nProblems for Tutorial 2\n\nOne\n\n1\n\n7 August\n\nProblems for Tutorial 3\n\nTwo\n\n1\n\n14 August\n21 August\n\nProblems for Tutorial 4\n\nThree\n\n1\n\nProblems for Tutorial 5\n\nFour\n\n2\n\n28 August\n\nProblems for Tutorial 6\n\nFive\n\n2\n\n4 Sept\n18 Sept\n\nSemester Break\nNo tutorials; Semester Test\n\nNONE DUE\n\n--\n\n25 Sept\n\nProblems for Tutorial 7\n\nSix\n\n2\n\n2 Oct\n\nProblems for Tutorial 8\n\nSeven\n\n1\n\n9 Oct\n\nProblems for Tutorial 9\n\nEight\n\n2\n\n16 Oct\n\nProblems for Tutorial 10\n\nNine\n\n2\n\n23 Oct\n\nProblems for Tutorial 11\n\nTen\n\n1\n\n*All tutorial and assignment problems are on Canvas.\nAssignment Grading:\nAll assignments can be answered by diligently studying the textbook and materials\ncovered in lecture and tutorials. Assignments are not marked in detail and as part\nof your personal feedback, you should always review the detailed solutions\navailable on Canvas. A full mark on an assignment does not necessarily mean\nthat you were 100% correct or have produced the best possible answer. It is in\nyour best interest to sort out problems or misconceptions straight away (so that\nyou do not keep making the same mistakes). If necessary, follow up with your\ntutors or the Help Centre.\n\n5\n\n\fThe Table above indicates that five of the assignments are worth 1 mark each and five\nare worth 2 marks each. An assignment worth 1 mark will receive a mark of 0, 0.5 or 1\nand an assignment worth 2 marks will receive a mark of 0, 1 or 2.\n\uf0b7\n\nHalf of the available mark(s) for a particular assignment will be allocated for\nattending the tutorial on time, handing in the assignment at the end of the\ntutorial, and having reasonably attempted the problems.\no If your tutor considers your assignment to be completely unreasonable--a\nlack of effort is clearly shown--then the tutor will NOT award you this half\nof the available mark(s).\no In this scenario you will likely receive a mark of \u201c0\u201d for the assignment,\nbecause it is unlikely that you will meet the criteria for the other half of the\navailable mark(s).\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe other half of the available mark(s) will be awarded based on reasonable\ncorrectness. Reasonable correctness will be determined as follows:\no\n\nThe course co-ordinator will select five or ten items for all tutors to review.\nWhen the assignment is worth 1 mark, five items will be selected, and\nwhen the assignment is worth 2 marks, ten items will be selected. These\nitems could be a figure, a journal entry, a discussion point, or even the\nspelling of a word, such as \u201creceivable.\u201d\n\no\n\nYou will need to achieve 60% correctness of the items selected for your\nassignment to be deemed \u201creasonably correct\u201d.\n\nNote that assignment questions are not marked in full. Our system has been designed to\nprovide you dual incentives: 1) to complete all problems to a high standard and 2) to\nself-review your work. Both these tasks are critical components for success in this\ncourse.\nOur experience suggests that the more meaningful reward lies not in the\nassignment marks, but in the higher test and exam grades that result from the\npractice and self-review not only of the assignments, but also the tutorial\nproblems.\n\nE-mail policy\nE-mail queries should only be used for questions that require a simple reply. You may be\nasked to go to Help Centre/office hours for an answer. Your email will not be answered\nif: (i) the answer can be found in this course outline, (ii) the information has been\nannounced or otherwise is provided on Canvas, or (iii) your name and net ID is not\nincluded within your email.\n\nMid-semester test\nThe mid-semester test will start at 6:30 PM, be an hour and 30 minutes long, and will\ncover Chapters 1-5, including the lecture material on GST.\nRegarding ratios, no formulae sheet will be provided.\nThe venues for the test will be announced and posted on Canvas. Where necessary, an\napplication for aegrotat or compassionate consideration should be made to Registry\n(through Student Health or Counselling Services) within one week of the test.\nOccasionally students can have a clash between the time of a mid-semester test in this\ncourse and with a mid-semester test for another course they are taking. In that situation,\nthe student must notify the course co-ordinator at least five whole working days\nprior to the date on which the test is scheduled to enable alternative arrangements\nto be made. Failure to do so may result in the student being unable to take the\ntest.\n\n6\n\n\fChecking your grades\nYou should check your assignment and test marks against Canvas. Contact:\n1) Your tutor for questions on assignment marks. Tutorial streams, assigned tutors, and\ntutor contact information will be posted on Canvas in Week 1.\n2) The course coordinator for questions on test marks.\nIf you dispute an assignment mark, you must contact the appropriate individual by Friday\n5 PM of the week after the assignment would have been returned in tutorial, or the mark\nwill stand. If you dispute a semester test mark, you must contact the course coordinator\nwithin one week after the mark was posted on Canvas.\n\nFinal examination\nThe final examination will be two hours long and comprehensive, covering material from\nboth before and after the semester test.\n\nImportant Note on Cheating on Assignments\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat, and\nviews cheating in coursework as a serious academic matter. The work that a student\nsubmits for grading must be the student's own work, reflecting his or her learning.\nThe first time you are caught cheating, which includes copying solutions or\nanother student\u2019s work, you will receive a \u201c0\u201d for that assignment, and your\nname will be placed on a \u201ccheaters list\u201d maintained by the Accounting &\nFinance Department. If you are caught cheating again, you will receive a \u201c0\u201d\nfor all 15 assignment marks, and further action may be taken against you.\n\nHe Tu\u0101kana Programme\nWhat is He Tu\u0101kana Programme?\nHe Tu\u0101kana is a student centred programme designed to help M\u0101ori and Pacific students\nenrolled in the Business School.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking, plagiarism\ncan occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit acknowledgment. Work can\nbe plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal articles, the internet, and other\nstudents\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be reviewed against electronic source\nmaterial using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be\nrequired to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt about\nhow to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student Learning\nCentre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further information\nabout academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: https://policies.auckland.ac.nz/policies/Policies/policy-displayregister/guidelines-for-the-conduct-of-coursework.pdf\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for the\nwork. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee, where further\npenalties can be imposed.\n\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to seek\nassistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the amount and\ntype of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments, including group\nwork. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends, parents, SLC tutors, and\npaid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that can\nbe given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give a copy\nof the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work, not an\nelectronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if required. A\ncopy of the guidelines is available at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of referencing\nand how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students reference correctly,\nuse references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some major reference formats\nwith examples.\n\nINCLUSIVE LEARNING\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK\nStudent feedback is encouraged in this course. During the semester, students may directly\nsubmit their feedback to the lecturer through a face-to-face appointment, or they may wish to\nsubmit feedback through the class representative.\n\n\f5\n\nECON 221 \u2013 Course Outline 2017\n\nClass representatives\nAt the beginning of each semester, you will elect a class representative for the course [1]. The\nrole of the class representative is to gather feedback from students in the course and bring this\nto the lecturer and/or the Department. Class representatives\u2019 email addresses are posted on\nCANVAS and you are encouraged to contact them with feedback relating to the course. You\nare also encouraged to talk to the class representatives in person.\n\nStaff-Student Consultative Committee\nClass representatives also submit feedback to the Department of Economics Staff Student\nConsultative Committee (SSCC), which meets up to three times per semester to gain feedback\nregarding the course. Only class representatives may attend the SSCC meetings, and they will\nask the class for feedback before the SSCC meeting.\n\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nAt the end of the semester, you could have the opportunity to submit an evaluation of the\ncourse in a formative feedback questionnaire.\n\n[1] An election will not take place if the number of applicants for the class representative positions\nequals the number of positions available.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/COMLAW740B.pdf", "text": "The University of Auckland Business School\nCourse Outline 2014\nCOMLAW 740 A&B\nSemester 1 and 2\n\nCourse Prescription\nAn advanced study of the breadth of the New Zealand income tax base, including the different\nconcepts of income, its timing and recognition. Comparison between the nature of capital and\nincome, and the differing treatments of each, provides a deeper understanding of the policy\nbehind the New Zealand income tax regime. The course provides both a theoretical\nbackground and detailed technical knowledge of the scope and application of the most\nsignificant regimes for income, deduction and timing in the Income Tax Act 2007.\nGoals of the Course\nThe paper is an advanced course studying New Zealand\u2019s tax regime. The objectives of the\ncourse are to provide students with both a theoretical background and high level of technical\nknowledge of the scope and application of the most significant aspects of taxation under the\nIncome Tax Act 2007.\nThe course provides students with an opportunity to increase their research, writing and group\npresentation skills by the completion of one major seminar paper on a topic chosen by each\nstudent, which is presented to the class. The final exam requires students to apply all aspects\nof the domestic tax regime they have mastered during the course. Emphasis is therefore\nplaced on good analytical skills and presentation of researched, comprehensive and well\nreasoned solutions.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents who take and pass this course will be able to:\n1. Identify and comprehend the major aspects of the tax regimes in the Income Tax Act\n2007\n2. Analyse the policies and principles underlying those regimes\n3. Appraise and analyse the different tax treatment of comparable structures and types of\nincome and expenditure\n4. Analyse the application of the various tax regimes to business transactions for the\npurposes of providing advice and administrating the tax system\n5. Demonstrate by synthesis enhanced research, writing and presentation skills\n6.

In preparation of their papers, students will be expected to be able to make use of the\nappropriate library and internet resources, including but not limited to:\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand, United Kingdom, Australian and other case law;\n\n\uf0b7\n\nAcademic journals (held in the Auckland University collections or on Lexis/\nNexis);\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand Government materials, including:\n\uf0b7\n\nAll published New Zealand IRD material\n\n\f\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand Government Discussion Documents\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand Consultative Committee Documents\n\n\uf0b7\n\nStatutory material both current and historical.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTax treaties.\n\nThere are a variety of on-line resources available that will assist students in this course. Davis\nLaw Library staff are available to assist students in accessing all on-line materials available.\nA course book will be distributed to students prior to the course. Please endeavour to read as\nmuch as you can.\n(List any prescribed or recommended textbooks, readings and other resources such as\nsoftware packages; availability of a coursebook, CECIL or other on-line resources.)\nAssessment\nThe final grade for the course is made up by the following:\nSeminar Paper (including 10% for presentation)\nAttendance and Participation in seminars\nFinal Take-home Exam\n\n50%\n10%\n40%\n\nDue to the technical nature of the Income Tax Act 2007, the course assessments test research\nand analytical skills. Each piece of written work requires students to demonstrate knowledge\nof a number of different regimes in the Act, thereby testing their depth of knowledge and\nunderstanding of the underlying policy.\nPlusage does not apply.\nPlease refer to the Postgraduate Guide 2014 for further information.\n\nSeminars:\nStudents must complete one seminar paper worth 50% each of the final mark. The grade for\nthis seminar has two components, covering both the written paper and the quality of its\npresentation.\n40% of the grade for the seminar is based upon a seminar paper of approximately 7,000\nwords. 10% of the grade is based upon the presentation of the seminar paper by the student to\nthe class in Part B of the course. The mark is based upon presentation skills, interest generated\namong the class and ability to communicate the topic clearly. The seminar and presentation\ngrades are separately assessed (meaning an excellent paper may be presented badly or a poor\npaper may be presented well \u2013 and the separate marks will reflect those differences).\nStudents must select their seminar topics from a list we provide them.\nStudents must hand in the final draft of their seminar paper to the Department on Friday\n19 September 2014 (i.e. a fortnight prior to the date of presentation in Part B). Copies of the\npapers will be distributed to all students before Part B commences.\n\n\fSeminar papers have a maximum limit of 7,000 words, which is to be strictly observed.\nStudents struggling to contain themselves within the word limits should discuss their paper\nwith one of the teachers at an early stage.\nPapers are expected to be well researched and considered works, which set out clearly their\nintended scope and deal with the subject in a well-structured fashion. Perspectives on a topic\nmay be gained from a historical or comparative analysis, or from insights provided by other\ndisciplines, eg accounting or economics. Their presentation should be of a high standard,\nsimilar to that required for submission to an academic journal. Case, text and journal citations\nshould be in the format prescribed by the Department of Commercial Law Style Guide.\nAttendance and Participation\nAttendance and participation are worth 10% of the final grade. Allocating marks to class\nparticipation reflects the desire to encourage feedback and discussion within the course. As all\nseminar papers are circulated one week before presentation, all students need to have read and\nconsidered these papers prior to the class, and be prepared to discuss them. The small size of\nthe classes encourages interaction and student participation.\nFinal Exam\nAt the completion of the course, all students will be required to complete a take-home exam\nworth 40% of their final grade. Unlike the seminars (where topics are chosen by students) the\nfinal exam will be the same for all students and will raise a number of issues and topics\ncovered during the course. Students will have two-three weeks to complete the final exam\npaper.\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: Selected Applicants with BCom, BCom(hons), LLB, LLB(hons) or similar.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/INNOVENT203G.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nINNOVENT 203/203G: THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1\n\nCourse Prescription\nStimulates new ways of thinking about enterprising behaviour in a multi-disciplinary\nmanner relevant to understanding and addressing real world challenges of today.\nIntroduces skills needed to identify and assess opportunities, solve problems creatively,\ncommunicate persuasively, work effectively in teams, and understand individual and\norganisational impact.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\u2022\n\nPrerequisite: BUSINESS 102 or MGMT 101 or 90 points passed or 60 points from\nPart I of the BE(Hons) Schedule.\n\n\u2022\n\nStudents in a BCom programme should enrol in INNOVENT 203 rather than\nINNOVENT 203G.

The course\nfocuses on issues faced when organisations engage in outsourcing, offshoring and\ninternationalisation. It equips students with the theoretical framework and tools to identify\ncore IT capabilities and analyse relevant activities for outsourcing and offshoring. This\ncourse will provide an overview of IT outsourcing concepts and practices and discuss new\ndirections of outsourcing in the context of Internet information management. Specifically,\nit introduced students to the fundamentals and theoretical perspectives of these\nphenomena and expose them to practical issues ranging from managerial to economical,\nfrom cultural to political, from methodological to regulatory. As such, the course leads\nstudents to understand global outsourcing through multiple lenses of information\ntechnology governance and operations and supply chain management and examine\noutsourcing from a wide range of perspectives, including economic, cultural and political.\nTopics covered include: vendor management; global outsourcing; outsourcing project\nmanagement and cross-border knowledge management.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nNil\n\nGoals of the Course\nGlobal outsourcing has become a key part of the firms\u2019 strategy for large or small multinational\norganizations. This course offers a substantive review of current and emerging trends in global\noutsourcing. We examine some of the challenging questions that firms face in the current market\nenvironment- What to outsource and how to outsource? How to protect IP and innovations, and manage\nsupply side strategies and relationships with vendors and clients? Irrespective of firms\u2019 preferences,\nfirms need to understand these pressing issues related to global outsourcing to compete and survive in\nglobal economy. We will draw from academic research and real world examples. During the course, we\nwill also read several cases, articles highlighting various aspects of global outsourcing and firms\u2019\nstrategies. Overall, the course focuses on developing skills in global outsourcing decisions. Students\nwill understand key factors that drive firms\u2019 outsourcing strategies and such knowledge will help them\nto gain competency in managing global outsourcing in real business contexts.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. understand the key concepts, frameworks, processes and strategies in\noutsourcing and offshoring in an international context;\n2. know project management principles in managing an organization\u2019s outsourcing\nprocess;\n3. develop managerial competence in the planning, development and management\nof outsourcing/offshoring programmes;\n4. understand various considerations associated with selecting outsourcing service\nproviders in different geographical locations, and developing and negotiating the\ncontract for an outsourcing agreement;\n\n\f5. master theoretical frameworks to understand, manage, and study global\noutsourcing;\n6. develop generic skills in effective communication, working individually and in\nteams, time management, data analysis and reporting, and creative problem\nsolving.\n\nContent Outline\n\nTopics that will be discussed include\n\u2022 Outsourcing and offshoring strategy\n\u2022 Developing and Managing the sourcing process\n\u2022 Selection of Service Providers\n\u2022 Contract management\n\u2022 Relationship management and dispute resolution\n\u2022 Cost and risk management\n\u2022 Knowledge and intellectual property management\n\u2022 Innovation in global outsourcing\n\u2022 Cross-cultural issues in global outsourcing\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nOne 3-hour session each week.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\n\n\fUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books,\njournal articles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed\nwork may be reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\nmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an\nelectronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the\nStudent Learning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website\nfor further information about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to\navoid plagiarism. It can be found at:\nhttps://policies.auckland.ac.nz/policies/Policies/policy-display- register/guidelines-forthe-conduct-of-coursework.pdf\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks\nfor the work. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted\nto seek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on\nthe amount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your\nassignments, including group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading\ngroups, friends, parents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance\nthat can be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required\nto give a copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired. A copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The\nUniversity\u2019s Referen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a\none-stop online resource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the\nessentials of referencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to\nhelp students reference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast\naccess to some major reference formats with examples.\n\n\fINCLUSIVE LEARNING\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements faceto-face and/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK\nStudent feedback is encouraged in this course. During the semester, students may\ndirectly submit their feedback to the lecturer through a face-to-face appointment, or\nthey may wish to submit feedback through the class representative.\n\n\fClass representatives\nAt the beginning of each semester, you will elect a class representative for the course[1].\nThe role of the class representative is to gather feedback from students in the course\nand bring this to the lecturer and/or the Department.

An\nimportant part of this explanation focuses on the role of confidence, expectations and\ncrowd psychology. These factors result in aggregate behaviour (e.g., demand in the whole\nNew Zealand economy) behaving in a different manner than would be suggested by simply\nstudying individual behaviour. Without some form of coordination, individual behaviour\ncan lead to inferior outcomes. This helps justify the need for good institutions and public\npolicy to raise welfare in nations.\nSecond, the course discusses how the right kinds of public policies and institutions can be\ndeveloped which focus the uncoordinated actions of individual households on good, rather\nthan bad, overall outcomes. In some countries, legal, political, economic and social\ninstitutions are able to coordinate private actions on stable and productive paths. Where\ninstitutional development is weak - as seems to be the case in much of the developing\nworld - private actions are poorly coordinated and the result is more macroeconomic\nvolatility and slower growth. Understanding what constitute good policies and institutions\nand how they can be designed to influence economic and business behaviour in desirable\ndirections is crucial.\nFinally, the course is intended to develop a simple framework that can be used to evaluate\nhow globalization is likely to change the performance of specific markets and thus assess\nthe associated risks, opportunities and implications for public policy.\n\n\fLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that you will:\n1. appreciate how business, government and the global economy interact;\n2. make more informed managerial decisions by having a better understanding of\nthe genesis of booms and busts, crises caused by internal or external shocks, and\nsocial and labour unrest; and\n3. have a more coherent framework for analysing how economic policy is set by the\npublic sector to influence macroeconomic phenomena. This framework should\nenable you to enjoy a competitive advantage as a manager or business owner.\n\nContent Outline\n1.

The processes of strategizing, the\nimpact of organisational contexts and the subsequent strategic tensions are explored so\nas to understand the adoption of various strategic practices.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\nAt least 30 points at Stage II and at least 15 points at Stage II in Management,\nInternational Business or Innovation and Entrepreneurship.\nRestriction: MGMT 302\nThe purpose of Strategic Management is to help pull together the different theories and\nskills you have acquired on your business studies-based educational journey. The course\nspecifically adopts the perspectives of the general manager, as they tend to be\nacquainted with all of the functional areas within an organisation. This course is casebased, and requires you to prepare and discuss cases in class. In order to do well in this\nclass you need to participate in the class discussions.\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nIn line with the views of de Wit & Meyer, this course seeks to develop your understanding\nof strategy in three key areas:\n\u2022\nKnowledge. To encourage the understanding of the many, often conflicting, schools\nof thought and to facilitate the gaining of insight into the assumptions, possibilities\nand limitations of each set of theories.\n\u2022\nSkills. To develop the ability to define strategic issues, to critically reflect on\nexisting theories, to creatively combine or develop theories where necessary and to\nflexibly employ theories where useful, to clearly articulate their analysis and its\nimplications.\n\u2022\nAttitude [Abilities]. To install a critical, analytical, flexible and creative mindset\nwhich challenges organisational, industry and national paradigms and problem\nsolving recipes.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. explain the nature of strategy;\n2. identify a company\u2019s strategy in terms of its content, process, and context;\n3. distinguish between activities in a company that are strategic and those that are\noperational;\n4. describe the strategic tensions and their corresponding strategic perspectives;\n\n\f5. know the main sources of each of the tensions, and their main proponents;\n6. formulate linkages between each of the tensions;\n7. illustrate the implications of each pole of the tensions as they apply to a company\nor case;\n8. employ the concepts and tools of strategy in order to construct a strategy;\n9. present an oral justification for a strategy or aspects of a strategy;\n10. evaluate the quality of a proposed, or actual, business strategy;\n11. develop and justify appropriate assumptions in order to deal with the complexity\nand ambiguity experienced by companies; and\n12. describe his/her stance and approach to the process of strategy.\n\nContent Outline\n\nThis course gives a broad overview of the essential aspects of strategic management at a\nlocal, national, and international level. The most fundamental distinction made in the\nfield of strategy is between strategy process, strategy content and strategy context.\nThese are the three dimensions of strategy that can be recognized in every real-life\nstrategic problem.\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nStrategy Process: The manner in which strategies come about is referred to as the\nstrategy process. Stated in terms of a number of questions, strategy process is\nconcerned with the how, who and when of strategy - how is, and should, strategy be\nmade, analysed, dreamt-up, formulated, implemented, changed and controlled; who\nis involved; and when do the necessary activities take place?\nStrategy Content: The product of a strategy process is referred to as the strategy\ncontent. Stated in terms of a question, strategy content is concerned with the \"what\"\nof strategy - what is, and should be, the strategy for the organisation and each of its\nconstituent units?\nStrategy Context: The set of circumstances under which both the strategy process\nand the strategy content are determined is referred to as the strategy context. Stated\nin terms of a question, strategy context is concerned with the where of strategy where, that is in which organisation and which environment, are the strategy process\nand strategy content embedded (de Wit & Meyer, 2005, p. 5).\n\nIn practice, these three \u2018threads\u2019 of strategy are tightly interwoven, and to some extent\nthe course seeks to unravel them so they might be better understood. Nevertheless,\nstrategic management is an integrative processes; see for example Ohmae (1982), an\nextract of which is in the text book. It is somewhat illusionary to split up the course in to\n\u201cbite size pieces\u201d in the hope that they will form a coherent whole and the end of the\ncourse. Thus, whilst a list of topics is provided, they cannot be simply mapped on to\nindividual weeks. The approach adopted in the course is to develop your understanding\nof the topics (albeit a different rates and by different amounts) each week.\nWeekly topics:\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is strategy?\nStrategic thinking\nStrategy formation\nStrategic change\nOrganisational purpose\nBusiness level strategy\nCorporate level strategy\nIndustry context\nStrategy innovation\nOrganisational context\nReview & Written case analysis\n\n2\n\n\fLearning and Teaching\n\nStrategy isn\u2019t something an organisation has, it is something people do (Jarzabkowski,\n2005). Thus, we centre our approach to teaching strategy on 'doing strategy' by\nspending most of our time together discussing strategy as it applies to a number of\ncases. However, it is important that you know the theory that supports many of the ideas\nupon which strategy is build. Consequently, this course has two facets - a weekly test (to\nensure that you have studied the assigned readings) and a weekly case discussion period\n(to develop your ability to apply the ideas about which you have read). This means that\nyou should have studied the assigned readings before taking the test. The purpose of the\ntest is to help you stay up to date with the readings, obtain regular and rapid feedback\non how you are doing in the course, and lay the theoretical basis for the subsequent case\ndiscussion. After the test, there will be a discussion of the ideas and issues raised by the\nreadings.\nThe focus of the second class session will be the exploration of the issues raised by the\nreadings in relation to a given case. Since participation accounts for a significant\npercentage of the final mark, attendance at these discussion sessions is highly\nrecommended. Achieving a high grade for the course is only possible by high quality\nparticipation during the discussions.\nManagers typically have little time to read, and even less time to write. They accomplish\nmost of their communication orally. You have to learn how to do analysis effectively and\ncommunicate it efficiently. The case discussions are chances for you to practice\nconvincing your peers that your approach has insight and value for the given managerial\nchallenge.\n\nTeaching Staff\n\nAssociate Professor Ljiljana Erakovic\nOffice: OGGB, Level 4, Room 471\nTel: 373 7599 ext 86855\nEmail: l.erakovic@auckland.ac.nz\nOffice hours: TBA\n\nLearning Resources\n\nThe textbook upon which this course is based is:\nde Wit, B., Meyer, R., Smith, P. & Erakovic, L.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available\nat: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\nAssignment Submission\nAll assignments for this course should be submitted through the Assignments section of\nthese course webpages, after going through the standard review process.

The objective will be achieved through a defined\nprocess of (usually) sequential steps. Class participants will clarify a personally-relevant\nresearch idea; find, understand and assess prior research related to the topic; evaluate\npotential data sources and acquire usable data; develop an appropriate approach to\nanalysing that data; and write a clear and convincing research report which encapsulates\n\n\fthe important elements developed through the research process. Class sessions are\ndesigned to facilitate this research process, and will include interactive lectures, exercises,\npeer review and one-to-one consultation with members of academic staff.\nWeekend streams will meet for six hours each fortnight during Quarters 2 and 4, while\nCohort A07 will usually meet for three hours one evening per week. Class time will be used\nfor a combination of lectures and seminar discussions of individual projects. In addition to\nattending class, students should be prepared to spend about another fourteen hours per\nfortnight on activities related to this course. In Quarter 2 you will identify your research\ntopic and select a specific issue for further investigation. You will then assess the theories,\nfindings and approaches of other researchers using a range of quality sources.\nThe key output for Quarter 2 will be a summary of background readings concluding with a\nrefinement of your chosen problem. In Quarter 4 you will use your summary of background\nreadings as a starting point and explore your issue further using business data and\ninformation drawn from your research context. You will analyse your data and write a wellargued and evidence-based report that addresses your business problem, draws on the\nresearch of others and your own findings to culminate in a coherent set of conclusions and\nrecommendations.\nThis is a two quarter course [Q2 and Q4], with a single grade reported at the end of Q4.\nThe MBA Breakfast for December 2017 will feature a selection of presentations from both\ncohorts. Presenters will be chosen on criteria including quality of the research, accessibility\nof the topic to a general business audience, and presentation skills.\n\nCohort 07&08 Teaching Staff\n\nCohort 46 Teaching Staff\n\nDr. Benjamin Fath\nLecturer\nGraduate School of Management\nOffice: OGGB 374\nEmail: b.fath@auckland.ac.nz\n\nDr. Elizabeth George\nProfessor\nGraduate School of Management\nOffice: OGGB 344\nTel:\n09 9235310\nEmail: e.george@auckland.ac.nz\nAvailable during class & by appointment\n\nDr. Nina Brosius\nEmail: n.brosius@auckland.ac.nz\nAvailable during class & by appointment\n\nDr. Nina Brosius\nEmail: n.brosius@auckland.ac.nz\nAvailable during class & by appointment\n\nLearning Resources\nA suggested textbook for this course is: Jankowicz, A.D.

More details on each will be provided\nduring the quarter.\nThe first, Problem Description and Summary of Background Readings, gives you an\nopportunity to present the topic you have chosen to research, the nature of the specific\nproblem, and a summary of what has been studied earlier. The aim of this assessment is\nfor you to demonstrate that you have a \u201cresearchable\u201d problem and that you know what\nhas been written about this problem earlier in the academic or managerial literatures. The\nassessment will be up to 3000 word document (approximately 12 pages, double spaced,\n12 point font). This document is due in Week 9 (for the weekly class) and May 26 (for the\nfortnightly class), and will be given to two peers on that day.\nThe second type of assessment, Peer Feedback, gives you an opportunity to read and\ncritique the work of two classmates and give them developmental feedback. The aim of\nthis assessment is for you to develop the skill of identifying the strengths and weaknesses\nof a proposed research project. You will also have to suggest to the authors what they\ncould do to make their problem description or summary of research stronger. Your\nfeedback will be marked by the academic staff for the quality of the feedback and its\u2019\nconstructive tone. You will provide peer feedback to two classmates in Quarter 2 and\nanother two classmates in Quarter 4. Each document of feedback will be approximately\n500 words (approximately 2 pages, double spaced, 12 point font). In Quarter 2, you will\nreceive the report to which you will give your feedback in week 9/May 26. You will have to\nsubmit your peer feedback electronically by the end of the working day (5:00 pm) on June\n9 for both the weekly class and the fortnightly class.\nThe third type of assessment, Project Plan and Final Research Report, gives you the\nopportunity to demonstrate your ability to systematically find answers to the research\nquestion identified in Quarter 2. This assessment should be informed by the feedback\nthat you will have received in Quarters 2 and 4 from your peers and the academic staff.\nYou assessments will be graded based on the quality of your ideas as well as the manner\nin which you present your work. You can find more information on how we will assess\nyour work in the grading rubrics at the end of this document.\nThe broad relationship between these assessments and the course learning outcomes is as\nfollows:\n\nLearning\nOutcome\n1 Problem\n\nProblem\ndescription\nX\n\nSummary\nof\nBackground\nReadings\n\nPlan\n\nResearch\nPresentation\n\nX\n\nProject\nReport\nX\n\n\f2 Literature\n3 Analysis\n4 Decision making\n5 Communication\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating.

Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the instructor. If you have been granted special examination\nconditions, please make the instructor aware of these at the beginning of the quarter, so\nthat appropriate arrangements can be made.\n\nStudent feedback\nJust as I will be giving you feedback throughout the quarter I will also expect you to give\nme feedback on ways in which I can facilitate the learning environment in the class. I\ncannot promise that I will make all the changes that you might want but I will certainly\nlisten to you and attempt to find a solution that will work for everyone.\nThis course has been offered by the Graduate School of Management previously. In\nresponse to feedback from 2016, we made the following modifications:\n- Peer feedback will now be a formalised part of the learning experience.\n- The word count of the final report is now reduced to accommodate this change.\nStudents will be asked to complete a course evaluation near the end of the course to\nprovide feedback that will be used to inform the ongoing development of the course.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\n\n\fWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\nCHEATING AND PLAGIARISM\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may\nbe reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\nmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an\nelectronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to\navoid plagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed\n\n\fGrading rubric (B): Peer feedback\nCriteria\n\nExemplary\n\nCompetent\n\nUnsatisfactory\n\nProblem statement\n\nDemonstrates an accurate understanding of the research\nproblem\n\nShows an adequate understanding of the research\nproblem\n\nFails to address the question/task\nappropriately\n\nCritiques with clarity, reflection, and insight into the topic\n\nDisplays basic subject knowledge\n\nLacks clarity, may be confused, or is\notherwise incomplete\n\nIncorporates key information from lectures, observations and\nreadings.

The course provides an analysis of the powers,\ndiscretions and responsibility of the Commissioner and the Inland Revenue Department.\nMajor topics include the Department\u2019s assessment function and taxpayer self-assessment, the\nBinding Ruling regime, the Commissioner\u2019s statutory powers of investigation and\ninformation gathering, the exercise of discretions and administrative decisions, and the role of\njudicial review.\nGoals of the Course\nThe paper is an advanced course studying New Zealand\u2019s tax administration processes set out\nin the Tax Administration Act 1994. The objectives of the course are to provide students with\nboth a theoretical background and high level of technical knowledge of the scope and\napplication of the most significant aspects of the law and practice. This includes an\nunderstanding of the Commissioner's investigative powers and restrictions on these powers. It\nexamines other administration features including judicial review, the time bar, the care and\nmanagement provisions, binding rulings, civil and criminal penalties, and information\nexchange issues.\nThe course provides students with an opportunity to increase their research, writing and group\npresentation skills. The final exam (which is by way of answering a case study) requires\nstudents to apply all aspects of tax law and administration which they have mastered during\nthe course. Emphasis is therefore placed on good analytical skills and presentation of\nresearched, comprehensive and well reasoned solutions. In addition the course gives the\nstudent the opportunity to participate in a group discussion which is conducted in a supportive\nand entertaining environment.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents who take and pass this course will be able to:\n1.

The work that a student\nsubmits for grading must be the student's own work, reflecting his or her learning. Where\nwork from other sources is used, it must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This\nrequirement also applies to sources on the world-wide web. A student's assessed work\nmay be reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\nmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic\nversion of their work for computerised review.\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions, the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up-to-date information via Canvas and the university website.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/ACCTG721.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nACCTG 721: RESEARCH IN MANAGEMENT CONTROL (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\nCourse Prescription\n\nProvides an insight into the theoretical and empirical literature relating to management planning and\ncontrol in private and public sector organisations.

The work that a student submits for grading\nmust be the student's own work, reflecting his or her learning. Where work from other sources is\nused, it must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This requirement also applies to sources\non the world-wide web. A student's assessed work may be reviewed against electronic source\nmaterial using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be\nrequired to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review.\n\n\fIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your courses\nthroughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions, the University has contingency plans to\nensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is fair, and not compromised.\nSome adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In the event of a disruption, the\nUniversity and your course coordinators will make every effort to provide you with up-to-date\ninformation via Canvas and the university website.\n\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\n\n\fincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party, you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available\nat: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MANAGEMT707-2007.pdf", "text": "The University of Auckland Business School\nCourse Outline 2007\nMANAGEMT 707: BUSINESS RESEARCH: STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT\n(30 POINTS)\nCourse Prescription\n\nSupervised empirical research involves an organizational assessment.

The application of these ideas to finance, and to\nfinancial and managerial accounting.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nRestriction: ACCTG 702\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nThis course examines the role of information, knowledge, incentives and measurement in\ncontracting, organisational design and the governance of economic transactions. In doing\nso, it applies the academic frameworks of property rights, transaction cost economics,\nagency, and dynamic capabilities theory. Hence, students will read, understand and\ndiscuss articles that develop and apply these frameworks in ways that contribute to our\nunderstanding of accounting, management control, corporate governance, and finance\nissues.\nStudents will also examine research articles that address contemporary\ngovernance issues.\nA deeper understanding of accounting and finance arises out of an understanding of its\nrole within and between organisations and within society more generally.\nNeither\naccounting nor finance exists in a vacuum. Both can be thought of as governance\nmechanisms. The nature of each will depend upon what the firm does \u2013 what assets it\nowns or has access to, and how it completes transactions internally and externally by\ntransacting with other entities.\nThinking about the issues also depends on the institutional environment as laws, and\nthe extent to which they are enforced, differ across countries.\nThis course poses fascinating, practical questions, and seeks to provide frameworks\ncapable of providing answers \u2013 answers needed for:\n(a)\n(b)\n\nEconomic analysis of business structure and decisions, and\nSuccess in other graduate accounting and finance courses.\n\n\fLearning Outcomes\nOn completion of this course a successful student will be able to:\n1.\n\nIdentify the major factors that explain why some economic transactions are\norganised within firms, why some are organised through contracts, and the\nimplications for the boundaries of the firm.\n\n2.\n\nExamine and assess the efficiency of various organisational forms.\n\n3.\n\nExplain how different forms of innovation (organisation structures, processes and\nprocedures; and business models) help firms to create and capture value.\n\n4.\n\nCompare and evaluate centralised and decentralised models of decision rights and\ncontrol within firms and other organisations.\n\n5.\n\nUnderstand and explain why economic institutions and their ownership and\ngovernance structures differ across countries.\n\n6.\n\nEvaluate CEO pay structures and their incentive effects.\n\n7.\n\nExplain how to evaluate the relationship between governance and performance.\n\n8.\n\nAddress practical questions such as: contracting out, contract design,\norganisational architecture, the level and composition of CEO pay, the size and\nstructure of boards and their committees, the value of non-voting shares, mixed\nmodel ownership (i.e., listed companies with some government ownership) and\nMaori organisations.\n\nContent Outline\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nThe Problem of Coordinating Effort to Create and Capture Value\nOrganising Transactions and Firm Boundaries\nOrganisational Architecture and Management Control\nEconomic Institutions and Performance\nRemuneration: Incentives, Focus and Politics\nBoard structure and other governance metrics\nPaper Presentations.\n\n\fInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the course coordinator.\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThis course consists of twelve 180-minute sessions convened weekly.

The remaining sessions introduce,\nevaluate and discuss contemporary governance issues, while at the same time continuing\nto develop a rigorous framework for evaluating governance issues.

In the proposal, you\u2019ll design an empirical investigation in which\nyou test conceptual or substantive hypotheses that interest you. The hypotheses can\ndeal with accounting, marketing, information systems, or management theories \u2013\nwhatever your discipline is. The hypotheses must reflect that your study is a behavioral\nstudy, which involves constructs such as attitudes, perceptions, values, personalities,\nbehavioral intentions and behaviors. The hypotheses must be based on a careful,\nexhaustive review and analysis of published literature. That analysis will also contain a\ncomprehensive methodological critique of existing literature using the principals we\ncover in class.\nProposals should include traditional Literature Review, Conceptual Analysis, and\nHypotheses chapters. Your proposal must also contain a complete Methods chapter, which\nis typical of a dissertation proposal. This chapter must include all of the important choices\nyou made about how to conduct your research, and the corresponding rationales for those\nchoices. It must also include most of the details of your proposal procedure. The methods\nshould be spelled out so clearly that another graduate student could pick up your proposal\nand know how to carry out your research. Following the Methods, your proposal must\ncontain an Analysis chapter as a substitute for the typical Results chapter. In this chapter,\nyou should carefully describe how you will analyze the data from your research design in\na way that clearly tests your hypotheses.\nAll proposals must be prepared according to the dissertation format prescribed by the\nGraduate School. You may also refer to the American Psychological Association (APA)\nPublication Manual, 7th Edition, or by the Style Guide for the Academy of Management.\nThe Academy Style Guide is at the back of the first issues of Academy of Management\nJournal in any of the past few years. The text of the proposal (i.e., not counting tables,\nfigures, and appendices) should not exceed 20 pages of double-spaced, Times New Roman\n12-pitch font, with 1-inch margin on each side.\nYou will receive comments from me on the first draft of your submission. My evaluations\nof your submission will largely follow the Academy of Management Journal\u2019s Reviewer\n\n6\n\n\fThen\nEvaluation Form (http://amj.aom.org/site/misc/ReviewerEvaluationForm.pdf).\nyou\u2019ll have about 2 weeks to revise and resubmit your submission. When you hand in your\nfinal submission, you need to include a summary of changes you have made to your\nsubmission in response to each of my comments. This process is simulating the journal\npaper submission process that you will encounter in your future academic career.\n\nTake Home Test (30%) (8 September)\nThe take home test is a review of a published article. Students will utilize what they have\nlearnt from the course to review and criticize a given article. It will be a take home test\nand students will have 24 hours to submit the review report.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAttention is drawn to University policy and regulations on honesty and integrity in\nacademic work, and to the disciplinary guidelines and procedures applicable to breaches\nof\nsuch\npolicy\nand\nregulations.\nDetails\nmay\nbe\nfound\nat https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/learning-and-teaching/policies-guidelines-andprocedures/academic-integrity-info-for-students/about-academic-integrity.html\nStudents are required to submit a statement that they are aware of these policies,\nregulations, guidelines and procedures with each version of the research proposal.\n\nFeedback\nFeedback will be sought at the end of the course. Any other feedback about the course\ncan be given to the instructor at any time either face to face, by email or by\nanonymously placing feedback in the instructor\u2019s letter box.\n\n7\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/FINANCE781.pdf", "text": "Finance 781: Topics in Institutional Investment\nCourse OutlineSemester 2 2014\n\nTeaching Staff\nDr Craig Ansley\nRoom 527\nPhone: 373 7599 ext. 86741\nEmail: c.ansley@auckland.ac.nz\nOffice hours: by appointment\n\nLocation and Time\nThursday 1.00-3.00pm\nOGGB\n\nCourse Description\nThis course offers an introduction to the issues facing institutional investors, and the market\nstructures and practices that have been established to handle them. The biggest players in the\ninstitutional investment market are superannuation funds, insurance companies and charitable\ntrusts, affecting virtually every citizen. Institutional investors form a huge part of financial\nmarkets, and their actions have a major impact on how these markets operate.\nWe will study a number of the components of the investment process typically adopted by\ninstitutional investors to govern their affairs, formulate their investment objectives, design\ninvestment structures to meet their objectives, appoint agents to manage those structures, and to\nmonitor and review their performance and decisions. (A short outline of the investment process\nis attached.) We will investigate the linkage between investment theory and practice in these\nareas.\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe main goal is for students to appreciate the responsibilities of institutional investors and the\nways they seek to meet these responsibilities within the market environment. The issues facing\ninstitutional investors are both theoretical and practical, ranging from investment theory to\nmarket realities to the legal, social and political constraints on how they can be dealt with. We\nwill concentrate on a subset of issues, and contrast New Zealand and global practices for\ninstitutional investors. We will attempt to reconcile commercial practice with investment theory.\nInvestment funds\nWe will illustrate the course material using three hypothetical investment funds, based loosely on\nmajor New Zealand funds. The issues facing these funds are typical of those encountered in\npractice. Each student will be assigned one of these funds for detailed analysis..\nAsset-liability study\n1\n\n\fAsset-liability models are computer simulation models used to investigate the cash flow\nrequirements of investment funds and to analyse the risk effects of possible portfolio choices.\nEach student will be required to conduct an asset-liability study on his/her investment fund to\nunderstand the nature of the investment choices faced by the managers of the fund. Detailed\ninstructions will be given on how to go about this exercise. The studies will necessarily be\nsimpler than actual studies carried out in practice, but the elements of the method and the nature\nof the results will be realistic.\nClass presentations\nThe course is based on seminars in which groups of students present topics using papers in the\nreading list. Students will be assigned to presentation groups at the start of the term. The presenters\nare expected to look beyond the assigned papers, not just summarise them. Some of the questions\nthat might be addressed are:\n\uf06e\nWhat is the importance of the paper to institutional investors?\n\uf06e\nWhat parts of the investment process is it concerned with?\n\uf06e\nIs it consistent with the theoretical and empirical finance literature?\n\uf06e\nAre there shortcomings in the argument?\n\uf06e\nWhat further questions need to be addressed?\n\uf06e\nWhat are the practical implications?\nThere could be two or three papers for a particular subtopic assigned to a presenter. Most of the\nreadings are drawn from the \u201cpractitioner\u201d literature. They are often short and not written at a\nhigh technical level, but they address issues that are very important for institutional investors,\nissues that must be dealt with on a day by day basis. For this course, the emphasis is on\nunderstanding why these issues are important, and what progress has made in using financial\ntheory to solve the associated problems.\nParticipation\nStudent participation in seminars is central to this course. The topics are broad and open-ended,\nand solid preparation followed by seminar discussions is an ideal way to learn and understand the\nissues. In particular, students will be called upon to describe how their investment fund would be\naffected by the ideas being presented.\nThe participation grade will be based on combination of evidence of preparation, and quality of\nparticipation.\nSummaries\nStudents who do not have presentation responsibility for the week are required to provide a onepage summary and critique with at least three questions for the topic presented. The questions\nmight be drawn from those suggested above for presenters, but may also look further afield.\nFinal presentation\nOver the course of the term students will formulate investment strategies for their investment\nfunds based on the course material. On the final day of class (23 October) the students assigned\nto each of the three funds will make group presentations on the strategies they have formulated\nfor their funds. An external expert will comment on the presentations.\n\n2\n\n\fFinal Exam\nThe final exam will be three hours, open book/open notes.\n\nGrading\nAsset liability study\nTopic presentations\nSeminar participation\nWeekly summaries\nFinal strategy presentation\nFinal exam\n\n15%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n15%\n40%\n\n3\n\n\fThe Investment Process\nGovernance\n\nPLAN\n\nObjective Setting\nAsset Allocation\nAsset Class Strategy\nPortfolio Structure\n\nIMPLEMENT\nManager Selection\nExecution\nPerformance Measurement & Evaluation\n\nREVIEW\nManager Monitoring\n\nGovernance is about ensuring that a portfolio is managed properly. Its focus is to\nensure that decisions and tasks are assigned to the most appropriate person or group,\nand to operate compliance systems.\nObjective Setting elucidates the investment result that the institution aims to achieve.\nThey must be realistic, and reconcile competing sub-goals.\nAsset Allocation determines what proportion of total assets will be allocated to each\nbroadly defined class of assets \u2013 e.g., equities, fixed income, or property. The asset\nallocation decision depends on the objectives defined in the previous decision step, and\nforecasts of asset class returns.\nAsset Class Strategy defines in detail how the allocation to individual asset classes will\nbe invested across sectors within the class \u2014 active or passive, combinations of styles\n\u2014 and sets up performance benchmarks and targets.\nPortfolio Structure matches specific investment managers to the chosen asset class\nstrategy. This step is critical in reviewing and changing asset class and manager\nstructure.\nManager Selection involves research to identify the best managers for the asset\nallocation and portfolio structure that has been chosen.\nExecution covers the steps necessary to implement the investment programme\nefficiently \u2014 transition, manager guidelines, custody, fee and contract negotiations.\nPerformance Measurement and Evaluation involves analysis of total fund, asset class\nand manager performance vs. benchmarks and peer groups. Results are compared\nwith objectives and changes that may be necessary are highlighted.\nManager Monitoring is ongoing research of investment managers to ensure that they\ncontinue to be suited to their respective roles in the portfolio structure, that there are no\norganisational or personnel changes that would endanger the fund\u2019s performance, and\nthat they are complying with their guidelines.\n\n4\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSMGT712.pdf", "text": "1\n\nCourse Outline 2017\nBUSMGT 712: BUSINESS ANALYTICS (15 POINTS)\nQuarter 3 (1176)\nCourse Prescription\nFocuses on fact-based and data-driven decision making in a volatile, uncertain,\ncomplex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world.

Introduces financial analysis, valuation,\nfinancing and source of funds for new ventures, market analysis and evaluation of\ninnovations in different stages of the innovation pipeline.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\nPrerequisite: Business 102 or MGMT 101 or 120 points of courses.\nPlease note that the time allocated to the course will be split between\nFinancial Management and Marketing.\n\nMarketing Components\n\nThis part of the course takes an integrative approach to innovation and marketing. We\nexplore key issues and tools related to bringing innovative new\nproducts/services/experiences to market.\nFirms often spend great resources developing new products and services only to find that\ncustomer adoption is far less or slower than expected. Sometimes the problem is that the\nfinal product fails to deliver on its promises. More often, however, the problem is marketing\nrelated; the firm might not have involved marketing activities effectively and early on to\nunderstand evolving customer needs prior to committing R&D resources, and/or might not\nhave properly estimated the product\u2019s market potential. This course will help students avoid\nsuch market failures and foster a cohesive understanding of how marketing activity at all\nphases of the innovation process can maximize the ultimate commercial success.\nMore specifically, through the use of design-thinking tools and process, the course will\naddress the aspects of developing innovations that address the aspects of desirability,\nviability and feasibility.\n\nGoals\n\nTo provide a basic understanding of, and introduction to, a market focused and designbased approach aimed at accelerating innovation.\n\n\fLearning Outcomes\n\n1. Expand thinking about innovation beyond the design and development of new products\nto other sources of value creation;\n2. Strengthen individual and team capabilities to identify customer needs, develop value\npropositions, and business models, and define business opportunities;\n3. Raise awareness of, and capabilities to work with, a set of core design tools.\n\nContent Outline\nModule 1: Discover & Comprehend \u2013 Desirability: what do people desire\nModule 2: Ideate & Create \u2013 Viability: what is financially viable\nModule 3: Experiment and Deliver \u2013 Feasibility: what is organisationally and technically\nfeasible\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThe marketing part of the course is based on experiential learning, i.e. you will learn about\ndesigning for desirability, viability and feasibility when actually doing it. Before each week,\neveryone should have completed the readings as well as individual and team work activities.\nStudents are expected to attend all sessions, contribute to discussions and actively\nparticipate. Due to the interactive and team-based nature of the marketing sessions in this\ncourse, these sessions will not be recorded.\n\nLearning Resources\nThe prescribed course material and articles will be available electronically on Canvas.\nStudents will need to acquire (and use) post-it notes, paper and pens so that work can be\nshared and analysed offline as well as online.\n\nTeaching Staff\nMarketing\nDr Charlotta Windahl\nDepartment of Marketing\nRoom 419, Level 4, Owen G.

A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of their\nwork for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for the\nassignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee, where\nfurther penalties can be imposed.\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work.

The\nparticular area of research must be jointly agreed upon by the lecturer and students, and\napproved by the Head of Department.\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe aim of the course is to allow the students to research a contemporary aspect of\ninformation systems in the New Zealand environment by undertaken a research project.\nThe output is at the discretion of the supervisor. Here is an example of one option. The\nmajor deliverable(s) must be written to a standard able to be published in the MSIS\nWorking Paper Series. The papers should be capable of refinement to a point where they are\nof sufficient standard to be accepted in, for example, the IEEE publications. The format of\nthe papers to be handed in will depend on the journal or conference targeted. Another\nwould be to mimic the requirements of the \"Research Essay\" of INFOSYS789.\nOne aim of this course is to create a vehicle where students can attract funding such as the\nFRST - TIF 'Undergraduate' funds. It is necessary to have industry sponsorship (involvement\nand some funds) to apply for this with a University supervisor. This is potentially worth\n$4000. See www.frst.govt.nz There must be a research component. Students may in some\ncircumstances be also apply to the faculty postgraduate research fund for a grant that will\nreimburse up to $1000 of research-related costs.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. introduce the student to a research topic; and\n2. understand synergy between Information Systems topics and other disciplines (e.g.\nSoftware Engineering and Taxation; Information Systems and Franchising).\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThere are no set lecture times. The students are expected to report progress either\npersonally of via email each week. Each student is required to prepare a project plan, report\non progress against the plan and submit work in progress based on the milestones forming\npart of the plan.\n\n\fEnrolment is at the invitation of the lecturing staff. It is up to the students to make a\ncase for a project selected and to argue their ability to carry it out.\n\nTeaching Staff\nTBA\n\nLearning Resources\nThere are no set course materials. Readings including current articles and web resources\nare provided on the topics covered.\n\nAssessment\nThe course is 100% internally assessed based on one or more projects to be handed in\nby the students.

It examines possible growth strategies and provides practical experience in\nidentifying, assessing, and valuing strategic opportunities for growth.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: BUSADMIN 768 or 778\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe paper presents a fieldwork opportunity to apply skills gained during previous MBA\npapers to a real business. The term \u201creal\u201d connotes a business with which participants\nwill interact on a regular basis during the course. Course participants will work in\nsyndicates with an allocated organisation to address a problem or issue chosen by the\norganisation\u2019s management, usually relating to growth management. The project will be\nconducted following a systematic framework called \u201cthe consulting process,\u201d similar to\nthat used by the top consulting organisations.\nWhilst other MBA papers have included extensive and intensive use of case studies,\nBUSADMIN 780 focuses on actual businesses with actual issues. The paper requires a\nholistic approach to problem-solving in which course participants will have to\ncontextualise problems, analyse such problems from multiple perspectives, and suggest\ninterventions. Such interventions will be supported by strong rationale and theoretical\nfoundation from relevant management fields. In case studies, the nature of the problem\n(e.g., strategy, people) is apparent because it is presented in the context of a particular\npaper. Because there is no clear frame of reference, fieldwork requires the ability to\ndiagnose the nature and drivers of issues.\nThis course will place participants in a real-time environment in which the people,\nproblems, and solutions have real impact. The overarching goal of the course is to\nsharpen participants\u2019 professional skills in:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nIdentifying a problem or opportunity faced by a business.\nDetermining what information participants need to learn about the problem or\nopportunity.\nDiscovering where to find relevant information and how to interpret the\ninformation.\n\n\f\u2022\n\u2022\n\nStrengthening the ability to function in a group and developing a crossdisciplinary understanding of business problems.\nRecognising that any organisation is a complex system in which relationships and\neffects among the parts must be considered.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. understand how to seek information relating to a business and propose a set of\nactions as a result of research, within the context of an uncertain organisational\nenvironment;\n2. gather, organise and interpret information, considering multiple perspectives,\nstakeholders and contingencies;\n3. analyse a highly unstructured and uncertain management-related problem, and\npinpoint theoretical models/frameworks from which to derive recommendations;\n4. analyse a problem from the perspective of management theory and apply\nobjective enquiry, systematic analysis and research; and\n5. participate in a team effort, perform to the expectation of peers, and manage\nintra-group relationships and conflicts.\nThose outcomes embed what is called the \u201cconsulting process\u201d or the \u201cconsulting\napproach\u201d to addressing business issues.\n\nContent Outline\nSession 1\n\nThe consutling process and approach\n\nSession 2\n\nOverview of general management tools and frameworks\n\nSession 3\n\nSyndicate WIP Presentation 1: Statement of work\n\nSession 4\n\nExternal Analysis\n\nSession 5\n\nProject mentorship and consultation\n\nSession 6\n\nPositioning analysis \u2013 Working with entrepreneurial companies\n\nSession 7\n\nSyndicate WIP Presentation 2: Project strategy\n\nSession 8\n\nInternal Analysis\n\nSession 9\n\nProject mentorship and consultation\n\nSesion 10\n\nPresentation to clients and expert panel\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nBecause this is a project-based experiential paper, sessions will provide an opportunity for\nproject supervision and team individual consultation with the lecturer.\nThere will be three types of class sessions: formal lectures, syndicate presentations, and\nproject review. Class sessions will serve many purposes \u2013 information dissemination is\nonly one of them. The class is primarily a forum for the students and instructor to critically\nreview and discuss the process and content of the allocated project. Participants need to\nbecome sufficiently self-aware as to how they might best exploit these different learning\nforms to their own benefit. The first two sessions will provide participants with some basic\ntools to undertake fieldwork. In addition, an introduction to management frameworks will\nbe provided to help participants with framing client problems within a holistic context and\nwith indentifying the potential nature of problems (e.g. strategic, operational, and\ntechnological).

The course will be delivered via three hours of\nlectures per week plus a one-hour tutorial. A tutor will also be available for\nconsultation four hours per week. Although this paper schedules only three formal\nhours of lectures per week students are expected to devote at least six additional\nhours each week in reading and revision and attend any tutorials that may be\noffered. Many of the concepts you encounter will likely be completely new to you.\nWe will guide you through the learning process in lectures. Gaining a deeper\nunderstanding will require a great deal of effort from you; we do not expect you to\nunderstand immediately and fully the concepts we discuss in lectures. We can only\nhope that you will think about these further after the lectures, read the textbook\nand complete the revision problems we have assigned.\n\n\fLearning Resources\nThe prescribed text for this course is Hull (2014) Fundamentals of Futures and\nOptions Markets (8th International Edition), Pearson. This textbook is the world\u2019s\nmost popular undergraduate textbook on derivative securities.\nYou can find on Canvas all relevant materials, including the course outline, lecture\nslides, miscellaneous resources, end-of-topic revision problems and copies of past\nmid-semester tests and final examinations.\nYou should regularly check Canvas for course announcements and other important\nmaterial that may be posted during the semester. Solutions to revision problems\nwill be available online through Canvas.\n\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements faceto-face and/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nStudent Feedback\nYou may be asked to complete course, teaching or tutor evaluations at the end of\nthe course, or formative mid-course evaluations/fast feedback during the course.\nYour feedback is appreciated and we endeavour to implement any suggested\nimprovements to the delivery of this course.\n\nPlagiarism, Copying and Cheating\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating or assisting others to cheat,\nand views cheating in coursework as a serious academic offence.

In coursework assignments submitted for\nmarking, plagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without\nexplicit acknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including\nbooks, journal articles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments.

Topics covered\ninclude people management, organisational planning, and resource issues.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\nPrerequisite: INFOSYS 110 or 120 or INFOMGMT 192 and 30 points at Stage II\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nBusinesses are increasingly adopting a \"project\" approach in many of their activities. This\ncourse is designed to provide an introduction to the management of projects in a variety of\nsettings, including software development, new product development, engineering and\nconstruction, research and development, organisational change, events management,\nadvertising and political campaigns.\nThe course will emphasise the inter-disciplinary nature of projects. As such the material will\ndeal with the technical, organisational, behavioural, financial, quality, logistical, and\ninformational aspects of managing (planning, scheduling, and controlling) projects. Thus,\nthe course will entail both qualitative and quantitative material.\nThis course places particular emphasis on students improving their skills w.r.t. the following\nattributes of the Graduate Profile for the BCom degree because these are most closely\nrelated to the skills required for managing projects in organisations:\n\u2022 identify problems and develop appropriate processes for their solution;\n\u2022 analytical and search skills;\n\u2022 development of coherent and justified arguments, and sound communication skills;\n\u2022 a capacity for self-directed learning throughout life;\n\u2022 an ability to adapt to uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course it is expected that a student will be able to:\n1. Analyse and assess the needs of organisations with respect to managing projects.\n2. Understand and utilise the inter-disciplinary nature of Project Management concepts,\nwith respect to their wide application and the multiple stakeholders involved.\n3. Utilise software and other analytical tools to develop competence in the management\nof projects across all phases of the project management life cycle.\n4. Develop generic skills in time management, self-directed learning, analytical reasoning\nand decision making for problem solving, and effective business communication in the\ncontext of project management tasks.\n\nContent Outline\n\nWeek\nWeeks\nWeek\nWeeks\nWeeks\nWeeks\n\n1\n2\u20134\n6\n7\u20138\n9 \u2013 10\n11 \u2013 12\n\nIntroduction to Project Management\nProject planning (1)\nManagerial issues for projects\nProject planning (2)\nProject execution and oversight\nProject closure, adjunct topics and final review\n\n\fThe procedures and the course schedule are subject to change though all effort has been\ntaken to plan lectures according to the schedule given. For further details please refer\nthroughout the semester to the information in CANVAS.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\n\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In the\nevent of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every effort to\nprovide you with up to date information via CANVAS and the university web site.\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nClasses will be held at the City campus and comprise a weekly lecture of three hours and a\nlab of one hour respectively. Lectures are active learning times and are therefore not\nrecorded. Labs provide examples to practice various technical skills and give opportunity to\nreflect on team work skills. The software package (Microsoft Project) used in the course for\nthe self-directed learning module is available in the Labs in OGGB, Level 0. The expectation\nis that students spend an average of 6-9 hours per week on the course outside of class (split\nbetween reading/studying/practicing and assignments).\nSignificant research has now accumulated showing that people learn best by self-discovery\nor \u201cactive learning\u201d. This class will use active learning techniques. At times students find\nthis frustrating because they are working on a case or exercise before the material has been\naddressed in class. However, this is the whole point of active learning. The only way a skill\nis developed \u2013 skiing, cooking, writing, critical thinking, solving thermodynamics problems,\nor understanding operational issues \u2013 is practice: trying something, seeing how well or\npoorly it works, reflecting on how to do it differently, potentially getting more information,\nthen trying it again and seeing if it works better. Further, studies have shown that if\nsomething is learned through self-discovery it will be retained much better than if it simply\npresented as fact.\nThe course content will present both contemporary theory (primarily aligned with guidelines\nof the Project Management Institute PMI) and practice (from case studies and examples in\nclass). A variety of instructional methods may be employed, including lecture presentations,\nin-class exercises and discussions, self-paced video tutorials, use of Internet-based\nresources, and guest-lectures from industry. To make the class more lively and valuable\nfor everyone, all students are expected to have read beforehand and thought about the\nmaterial assigned as preparation for each week.\n\nStudent Feedback\n\nIn the spirit of continuous improvement, feedback and ideas on this course are welcomed.\nRecent student feedback resulted for example in the choice of a shorter textbook for this\nsemester. Past student feedback resulted in Lectures being held just once a week (3-hrs\nblock), and also the weekly Lab tutorials being offered throughout most of the semester\nrather than only four times at the start of the course.\n\nTeaching Staff\nName\nRole\nLocation\nEmail\nPhone\n\nUrsula Dantin\nLecturer\nOGGB, Level 4, Room 441\nu.dantin@auckland.ac.nz\n373-7599 ext 84235\n\nName\nRole\nLocation\nEmail\n\nMasah Boroushaki\nLab Tutor & Course Coordinator\nN/A\nm.boroushaki@auckland.ac.nz\n\n\fLearning Resources\nPrescribed textbook:\nThe new prescribed text for the course is: Heagney, Joseph (2016).

Upon reasonable request, students will be\nrequired to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review.\nFurther details on these assessments will be provided at the first lecture and on CANVAS.\nThe broad relationship between these assessments and the course learning outcomes is as\nfollows.\nLearning\nOutcome\n\nIndividual Lab\nAssignments\n\n1\n\nGroup\nAssignment\n\nWeekly\nQuizzes\n\nMid-Semester\nTest\n\nExam\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n2\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n3\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n4\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nThe assessments will strongly emphasise students\u2019 ability to apply theory in lifelike/real-life\nscenarios as opposed to regurgitating theory in response to questions that test rote learning.\nStudents are expected to familiarise themselves with the section on Cheating and Plagiarism\n(below).\n\n\fINCLUSIVE LEARNING\n\nStudents are urged to privately discuss any impairment-related requirements in person\nand/or in written form with the course coordinator, lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nCHEATING AND PLAGIARISM\n\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for the\nassignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee, where\nfurther penalties can be imposed.\n\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\n\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\n\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of referencing\nand how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students reference\ncorrectly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some major reference\nformats with examples.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/PROPERTY342.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nPROPERTY 342: PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\n______________________________________________________\nCourse Prescription\nAn introduction to the process of property development, including application of\nanalytical methods to case studies.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: 90 points from PROPERTY 211-281\n\nGoals of the Course\nTo provide a firm understanding of Property Development for the Bachelor of\nProperty (BProp) degree programme.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1.\n\nUnderstand the process in progressing property development;\n\n2.\n\nAnalyse projects and determine feasibility;\n\n3.\n\nUnderstand the specific focus requirements on development for differing\nindustry sectors; and\n\n4.\n\nDisplay familiarity with specialist facets of property development including\nsustainability.\n\nContent Outline\nWeek 1\n\nThe course approach, property development definition and\nproperty market cycles plus the development process.\n\nWeek 2\n\nDevelopment process, stakeholder groups, cultural\nunderstanding, financial decision making criteria and lettable\narea measurement.\n\nWeek 3\n\nFeasibility studies and commercial assessment\n\nWeek 4\n\nProject & design concept development to maximise value.\n\nWeek 5\n\nStakeholder consultation, cultural perspectives and Authority\nconsents.\n\nWeek 6\n\nTest and investment assessments.\n\n\fWeek 7\n\nCommunication skills plus refurbishment and redevelopment.\n\nWeek 8\n\nTenancy fit out and office buildings, Risk Management.\n\nWeek 9\n\nGreen and sustainable development plus construction and\ncontrol.\n\nWeek 10\n\nConstruction and Control, Team Briefing and management\n\nWeek 11\n\nGroup assignment presentations\n\nWeek 12\n\nShopping centres\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThis course is taught on the city campus.

These comments from earlier years have\ncontributed to the nature of the assignments and structure of the course. For\n2017 the course is maintaining earlier changes to increase the assessment\nweighting of course work. Very short tests have been introduced during lecture\nperiods. Most lectures have also been updated with one lecture significantly so\nthe exam weighting for assessment has been maintained as 50%.\n\n\fIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in\nall your courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the\nUniversity has contingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues\nand your assessment is fair, and not compromised.

In the event of a disruption, the University and your\ncourse coordinators will make every effort to provide you with up to date\ninformation via Canvas and the university web site.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSINESS200.pdf", "text": "Course Outline\n2013\nBUSINESS 200: Understanding Business Context\n(15 POINTS)\nSemester 1\n\nCourse Prescription\nEquips students with an appreciation of the forces and actors at work beyond the market.\nIn order to compete in the marketplace firms need to understand their nonmarket\ncontext - culture, law, regulations, politics and the physical environment - which all affect\nbusiness opportunities and strategies. In turn, businesses can influence their\nenvironment, both through deliberate nonmarket strategies and as a result of their core\noperations.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: BUSINESS 102 or MGMT 101\nRestriction: MGMT 231, INTBUS 210\n\nGoals of the Course\nContemporary dynamics at the interface of business and society are the focus of this\ncourse. The course considers some of the most pressing issues facing business in society\nand is designed to encourage inquiry and advance critical reflection of the transforming\nnature of business and its environments.\nBusiness actors compete in the marketplace within specific political, legal, cultural, social\nand environmental contexts that vary from place to place and over time. The context in\nwhich businesses operate affects business strategies, opportunities and sustainability. In\nturn, business players, both individually and collectively, have the potential to alter their\nnonmarket environment in both positive and negative ways. In this course, we examine\nthe ways in which business is influenced by, and in turn influences, its nonmarket\nenvironment. The course asks students to evaluate a variety of contending perspectives\nand develop their capacity to apply different theoretical lenses to issues of contemporary\ndebate.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n1. Understand the range of contextual factors that affect business.\n2. Appreciate cross-national differences in business context as well as changes in\ncontext that have occurred over time.\n3. Demonstrate a critical understanding of contending arguments about the\nrelationships among business, politics, economic development, society and the\nphysical environment.\n4. Apply different ideas about business and its nonmarket environment to specific\ncontemporary situations.\n\nContent Outline\nThere are a number of themes central to the course.

The argument is highly compelling. The\nassessment is highly readable, enhancing the power of the ideas\npresented.\nThe student shows strength in the subject, fit to pass with some\ndistinction. The student shows the same faithful understanding of\nthe key concepts and theories as the C grade performance but\nreviews ideas with greater critical faculty or shows evidence of more\nextensive knowledge. The essay shows greater overall strength of\nargument than a C grade and is likely to demonstrate a more\nproficient approach. There are some areas for improvement but the\nwork shows the ability to perform beyond basic competence in the\nsubject.\nThe student shows basic competence in the subject, fit to pass. The\nstudent shows an advanced understanding of the relevant literature.\nThe major academic concepts and theories associated with the\ncourse are understood and appropriately applied to the business\nproblem in question. However, performance would be improved\nthrough greater more in-depth literature review or by a more active\napproach to learning. Arguments are adequately defended with\nappropriate theory and empirical research, supporting the points of\nview espoused. However, deeper reflection on relevant theory or\nmore vigorous engagement with the ideas of others would lead to\nimprovements in certain aspects of the argument. Word choice is\nappropriate but writing style may be somewhat pedestrian.\nThe student fails to show basic competence in the subject and is not\nfit to pass.

This\ncourse considers organisations from three levels: environments; formal and informal\nstructures; and people, as individuals and in teams. It recognises and explores\norganisational issues that cut across levels, including change, control, power, and\nconflict.

To develop the student\u2019s skill to think critically about organisational theories\nand problems.\nAttitudes: The student should be prepared for class and engage in discussions; the\nstudent should share their ideas and interpretations of organisational issues, and be\nable to critically analyse differing perspectives. Furthermore, they should be able to\nconsider the contemporary organisational environment and develop a perspective on\nthe relevance of organisational theory within this context.\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course students should be able to:\n1. Identify the major theorists of organisational theory and behaviour;\n2. Select theories and perspectives, appropriate to the context involved, in order\nto apply those theories;\n3. Apply these theories and perspectives to situations, both artificial and from\nthe student\u2019s own experience, in order to predict the likely outcome of the\nsituation;\n4. Critically evaluate situations, using these theories and perspectives, in order\nto identify appropriate interventions;\n5. Given situations, as in 3 above, make reasonable and appropriate\nassumptions and inferences;\n6. Identify logical inconsistencies in the student\u2019s own reasoning;\n\n\f7. Assess the social and ethical implications of these theories and perspectives,\nand is able to defend their choice of actions on these grounds;\n8. Compare and contrast theories and perspectives, and thus evaluate their\napplicability to situations. By relating theories and perspectives to one another\nis able to make links among theoretical schools. Thus, the student is able to\ndevelop a critique of theories and perspectives;\n9. Construct coherent academic essays that demonstrate the student\u2019s positions\nand rationale on organisational issues, in demonstrating the set of learning\nobjectives.\nLearning and Teaching\nThere are two hours of lectures per week plus a one hour workshop/discussion session.\nThe purpose of lectures is to explore aspects of course content.

Refer to Write that Essay for referencing and stylistic\nhelp\no Submit an electronic copy to Turnitin via CANVAS (see the \u201cAssignments\u201d tab\non Canvas)\no No paper copy submissions are accepted. Digital submission only.\nLate Assignments\nStudents are required to submit assignments on time. The lecturers may elect not to\nmark any late assignments. However, in the event of exceptional circumstances an\nextension may be granted if sufficient proof of the unforeseen event is provided.\nExtensions should be negotiated before the due date. A 15% penalty per day is\nlikely to apply to late assignments or late assignments may not be accepted\nfor grading.\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence. Plagiarism\nis a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking, plagiarism\ncan occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit acknowledgement.\nWork can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal articles, the\ninternet, and other students' assignments. A student's assessed work will be reviewed\nagainst electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms (Please\nnote: submitting an electronic version of your assignments is a requirement for MGMT\n211 \u2013 see above).\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for\nfurther information about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct for Coursework provides further advice on how to\navoid plagiarism. It can be found at:\nhttps://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/the-university/how-university-works/policyand-administration/teaching-and-learning/students.html\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks\nfor the assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University's Disciplinary\nCommittee, where further penalties can be imposed.\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted\nto seek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits\non the amount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing\nassignments, including group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading\ngroups, friends, parents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\n\n4\n\n\fThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance\nthat can be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required\nto give a copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your\nwork, not an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and\nproduce it if required. A copy of the guidelines is available at:\nhttps://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/the-university/how-university-works/policyand-administration/teaching-and-learning/students.html\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The\nUniversity's Referen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a\none-stop online resource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the\nessentials of referencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools\nto help students reference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives\nfast access to some major reference formats as examples.\nAssignment Feedback\nFeedback for assignment work is recognised as an important part of the learning\nprocess. An Assignment Feedback Form will be returned with assignment work. We\nhope you will find the feedback form a useful indicator of areas of strength and\nweaknesses in your assignment. We also encourage students who desire more\nfeedback on their work to arrange a meeting with their marker to discuss areas of\nimprovement, to help in isolating the strengths of their work.\n\n5\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MAORIDEV734.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nM\u0100ORIDEV 734: ACCOUNTING: WHAKATAKINGA TAHUA HUANGA\nM\u0100ORI (15 POINTS)\nQuarter 1 (1172)\nCourse Prescription\n\nAccounting practice for M\u0101ori organisations exploring the structure of accounting\ninformation and the use of accounting data for managerial planning, decision making and\ncontrol.

This course explores how to set up and develop the\nquestion.\nUnderstanding these ideas requires a research theme. We will explore this using the\ntheme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do we manage the IS work environment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Theories and topics we will\nexplore will be control theory, agency theory, change management, vendor management,\nself-control and social capital\nYou will know you have done well in the course if you can develop a proposal for your honors,\nmasters or PhD dissertation that you can shop to a faculty member to supervise. Also, you\nwill know you have done well if you can successfully obtain ethics approval for your proposed\nstudy.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the course, the student will:\n1. display familiarity with general principles behind research methods and approaches\nused within the field of information systems;\n2. develop academic thinking by presenting and evaluating academic arguments;\n3. be able to write a journal-quality empirical introduction, literature review and\nmethods section\n4. have written a proposal someone in the department is willing to supervise.\n\n\fContent Outline\nLesson\nNumber\n1\n2\n3\n\nTopic\n\nIntroduction:\nScience\nSocial\nScience/Writing the\nAcademic Paper\nChoosing a\nresearch topic\n\n4\n\nTheory\n\n5\n\nTheoretical Lens\n\n6\n\nLiterature Review\n\n7\n\nAcademic Culture\n\n8\n\nQuantitative Data\nCollection I:\nGeneral Concepts\nQualitative Analysis\n\n9\n10\n\nQuantitative Data\nCollection II:\nPsychometry\n\n11\n\nQualitative Data\nCollection\n\n12\n\nWriting the\nThesis/Dissertation\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nReadings IDeveloping Research\n(Kuhn 1996; Popper\n1959)\n(Lee 1991; Milgram\n1965)\n(Cachon 2012; Todd et\nal.\n2004) http://www.soc\nscidiss.bham.ac.uk/res\nearch- question.html\n(Doty and Glick 1994;\nGregor 2006; Markus\nand Robey 1988;\nSutton and Staw\n1995)\n(Barley and Tolbert\n1997; van de Ven and\nPoole 1995)\n\nReadings IIExemplar Papers\n(Tiwana and Keil\n2007)\n(Miner 1956; Pencil\n1976)\n\nExercise\n\nExplaining Colony\nCollapse Disorder\n\n(Sarker et al. 2006)\n\nANT Analysis of the\ntin can\n\n(Faraj and Xiao\n2006; Kirsch 1996;\nOrlikowski 1993)\nhttp://aisnet.org/gene Draft and final\nral/custom.asp?page= version of (Chua et\nal. 2012) with one\nSeniorScholarBasket\nhttp://people.cs.uchic round of response\nago.edu/~fortnow/pa to reviews\npers/growup.pdf\n\nCritique Kirsch\n1996\n\n(Straub et al. 2004)\n\n(Hunton and Beeler\n1997; Vance et al.\n2013)\n(Barley 1986)\n\nDeveloping a\nquantitative study\n\n(Bechky 2006;\nSchultze 2000;\nWeick 1993)\n\nTranscribe 2014 US\nState of Union\nAddress\n\n(Dyer and Wilkins\n1991; Eisenhardt\n1989)\n(Anderson and\nGerbing 1988; Petter\net al. 2007; Straub\n1989)\n\nThe math of\npublications\n\nOpen code 2013 US\nState of Union\nAddress\n\nThe anticipated class size should be no more than 25 students.

This will be done with the help of models from international trade theory that\nare important components of the toolkit of contemporary trade economists. The course\nwill also explore the phenomena of outsourcing and international mobility of labor\n(immigration) and capital (Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)). The course will analyze and\ncompare instruments of trade policy and evaluate their impact on domestic and\ninternational welfare. Finally, the course will study the world trading system, including\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) and international trade agreements.\nProgramme and Course Advice\nThe prerequisite for this course is ECON 201 Microeconomics.\nStudents wishing to specialize in International Economics should also consider taking ECON\n352 International Finance. Students planning to specialize in International Trade and\nInternational Finance at a higher level are advised to take this course (ECON 341) first.\nGoals of the Course\nThe objective of this course is to provide a foundation in international trade theory and\nenable the student to apply this theory to the study of issues in globalization, economic\nintegration and trade policy. Broadly, the goals are to i) understand existing patterns of\ninternational trade ii) ask if trade is beneficial for individual economies and the wider\ninternational community and if there are winners and losers from trade iii) study the\nconduct of trade policy, its objectives and impacts iv) gain familiarity with the world trading\nsystem.\nThis course is designed to serve both as a stand-alone course in international trade theory\nand policy, and as a foundation for further study of advanced international trade theory\nand international economics.\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course, students should ideally be able to:\n1)\nunderstand the major models of international trade and compare and contrast\nthem.\n2)\nunderstand the principle of comparative advantage, including its formal expression.\n3)\nanalyze the linkages between trade, labor and capital movements, international\nfragmentation of production, economic well-being and the income distribution and to\nidentify and critically examine policy implications of these linkages.\n\n1\n\n\f4)\napply equilibrium models to analyze the economic effects of policy interventions\nincluding tariffs, quotas, export subsidies, anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties and\nthe creation of preferential trading agreements.\n5)\ncritically analyze these policy interventions in terms of their costs and benefits,\nincluding their implications for economic well-being, performance and competitiveness.\n6)\nUnderstand major recent developments in the world trading system and comment\ncritically on their effects on individual economies and on the wider international\ncommunity.\nContent outline and schedule (tentative)\nWeek 1\nWeek 2\nWeek 3\nWeek 4\nWeek 5\nWeek 6\nWeek 7\nWeek 8-9\nWeek 10\nWeek 11\nWeek 12\n\nIntroduction; Trade and Technology (The Ricardian Model)\nSpecific-factors Model\nHeckscher-Ohlin Model; Tutorial/Class Activity\nMovement of Labor\nMovement of Capital\nTutorial/Class Activity; Increasing Returns to Scale\nBREAK\nTest 1; Offshoring\nImport Tariffs and Quotas; Tutorial/Class Activity\nExport Subsidies\nWTO/Trade Agreements; Tutorial/Class Activity\nReview; Test 2\n\nLearning and Teaching\nLectures:\nLectures will be held twice a week as follows:\nThursday\n\n12:00 PM - 2:00 PM OGHLecTh/102-G36\n\nLectures form a core component of this course.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\n\n\fLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\n\nE\n\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\nG\n\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\n\nAN\n\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\n\nH\n\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\n\nC\n\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version.

The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\nAssignment Submission\n\nAll assignments for this course should be submitted through the Assignments section of\nthese course webpages, after going through the standard review process.

Examines how\nentrepreneurs create and capture revenues and profits by recognising, assessing, and\nmarketing opportunities for new products or services based on science and technology;\ndeveloping new strategies and business models; validating markets; and selling into\nindustrial enterprises and markets.\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the wider role of\nentrepreneurial processes and practices in developing ventures. The course aims to\ndevelop this understanding through class discussions of theories, frameworks, techniques,\ncase studies, and action learning.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. Describe the role of entrepreneurship in developing and growing ventures and\noutline why risk and uncertainty are inherent to the process.\n2. Identify entrepreneurial techniques, models and strategies used in developing and\ngrowing science and technology ventures internationally.\n3. Apply entrepreneurial processes and practices to plan and execute research for\ncommercialisation of science and technology ventures.\n4. Communicate in written and verbal formats plans for how to develop and grow\nscience and technology ventures to the satisfaction of various stakeholders.\n\nContent Outline\nThis course provides a hands-on learning opportunity on how to start a scalable venture.\nIt is not about how to write a business plan, but about creating an entrepreneurial\nexperience. Students will learn both how entreprenurs zero-in an opportunity and what\ntechniques can be used to face the uncertainty of how a startup actually works. Students\nwill work in teams and simulate how to turn a great idea into a great company. Students\nwill learn how to apply the concept of lean start-up to craft each part of a company.\nStdudents will \u201cget out of the office/classroom\u201d as they test each part of your business\nmodel and then share with the rest of the class.\n\n1\n\n\fTeaching Schedule\nDate\n\n3PM-6PM\n22 Sep\n\n9AM-12PM\n23 Sep\n\n3PM-7PM\n6 Oct\n\n9AM-12PM\n7 Oct\n\n3PM-7PM\n20 Oct\n\n9AM-12PM\n21 Oct\n\n3PM-7PM\n3 Nov\n\n9AM-12PM\n4 Nov\n\n3PM-5PM\n17 Nov\n\n5.30-8.30PM\n17 Nov\n\n4pm\n20 Nov\n9AM-2PM\n24 Nov\n\nSession\n\nTopics\n\nTeacher\n\n1.

You and your team will attempt to find or make an opportunity and\nfollow the steps that you consider appropriate to start-up or ramp-up the venture. Your\ntask is to apply the principles and practices of lean start up, especially customer\ndevelopment. This assignment is kept deliberately open-ended for you and your teammates to select a path that is suitable and feasible given the risks and uncertainty that you\nare comfortable to bear.\n\n4\n\n\fComponent 2A: Ideation Presentation\nIt is worth 5 out of 50 points\nDue 21 October in class\nOn 21 October, each team will deliver a 10-minute presentation followed by 5 minutes of\nQ&A to the rest of the class. You are welcome to use any audio-visual resources that you\nconsider appropriate. Your task is to explain what the opportunity is and the approach\ntaken to either find or make the opportunity. As this is a presentation to the entire class,\nassignment extensions will not be granted and late submissions will not be accepted.\nThere will be two ungraded interim presentations (sessions 6 and 8) where the teams will\nshow the application of hypothesis testing and how initial assumptions and pivots are\nexplored.\n\nComponent 2B: Final Presentation\nIt is worth 10 out of 50 points\nDue 17 November in class\nOn 17 November, each team will deliver a 15-minute presentation followed by 10 minutes\nof Q&A to a guest panel. In this presentation, you will briefly introduce the opportunity\nand discuss in detail the steps that you would take to increase the chances of successfully\nforming a venture. Fundamentally, the teams will consolidate the findings of the application\nof lean start up. As this is a presentation to a panel, assignment extensions will not be\ngranted and late submissions will not be accepted.\nComponent 2C: Report\nIt is worth 25 out of 50 points\nDue 20 November at 4 pm\nYou will deliver a report with the background explanation of the topics covered in both the\nideation, the two interim presentations, and the final presentation. Importantly, you will\nsupport your approach with the concepts and ideas of entrepreneurship, reflecting on the\nreasons why you have taken a particular approach. You will explain the entrepreneurial\nprinciples underpinning your work, clearly wrapping the theory around the facts.\nAs time is limited, your report must be (a) concise-but-thorough, (b) produced in an\nappropriate professional style and format, and (c) not more than 20 pages in length\n(excluding references). If essential to your arguments, your report may be supplemented\nby not more than 10 additional pages of supporting evidence and exhibits.\nYou will submit: (a) two bound copies of your report, (b) two hard copies of your\npresentation slides, and (c) a digital copy of your report via email to Chris Woods\n(cr.woods@auckland.ac.nz). The hardcopy of your material (i.e., (a) and (b) above should\nbe delivered to Chris Wood\u2019s mailbox on Level 4)\nNote:\n\nAssignment extensions will not be granted and late submissions will not be\naccepted as the timeframe for reporting grades to the University is very tight.\n\nComponent 2D: Peer assessment\nIt is worth 10 out of 50 points\nDue 20 November at 4 pm\nPeer assessment is your opportunity to communicate to your peers about their\ncontribution toward the hands-on project.\nYou will allocate marks across your team mates and qualitative feedback to help them\nunderstand your judgement of their performance. It is important that you raise the\n5\n\n\fevaluation of people who worked hard for the good of the team and lower the evaluation\nof those you perceived not to be working as hard. Those who contributed should receive\nthe full worth of the final project grade; those who did not contribute fully should only\nreceive partial credit.\nThe quantitative feedback for each group member will be collated and used to calculate\nan individual peer assessment mark.

Application of these notions to the way in which\norganisations are structured. Identification of why some transactions are internalised and\nsome are undertaken through markets. The application of these ideas to finance, and to\nfinancial and managerial accounting.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nRestriction: FINANCE 702\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nThis course examines the role of information, knowledge, incentives and measurement in\ncontracting, organisational design and the governance of economic transactions. In doing\nso, it applies the academic frameworks of property rights, transaction cost economics,\nagency, and dynamic capabilities theory. Hence, students will read, understand and\ndiscuss articles that develop and apply these frameworks in ways that contribute to our\nunderstanding of accounting, management control, corporate governance, and finance\nissues.\nStudents will also examine research articles that address contemporary\ngovernance issues.\nA deeper understanding of accounting and finance arises out of an understanding of its\nrole within and between organisations and within society more generally.\nNeither\naccounting nor finance exists in a vacuum. Both can be thought of as governance\nmechanisms. The nature of each will depend upon what the firm does \u2013 what assets it\nowns or has access to, and how it completes transactions internally and externally by\ntransacting with other entities.\nThinking about the issues also depends on the institutional environment as laws, and\nthe extent to which they are enforced, differ across countries.\nThis course poses fascinating, practical questions, and seeks to provide frameworks\ncapable of providing answers \u2013 answers needed for:\n(a)\n(b)\n\nEconomic analysis of business structure and decisions, and\nSuccess in other graduate accounting and finance courses.\n\n\fLearning Outcomes\nOn completion of this course a successful student will be able to:\n1.\n\nIdentify the major factors that explain why some economic transactions are\norganised within firms, why some are organised through contracts, and the\nimplications for the boundaries of the firm.\n\n2.\n\nExamine and assess the efficiency of various organisational forms.\n\n3.\n\nExplain how different forms of innovation (organisation structures, processes and\nprocedures; and business models) help firms to create and capture value.\n\n4.\n\nCompare and evaluate centralised and decentralised models of decision rights and\ncontrol within firms and other organisations.\n\n5.\n\nUnderstand and explain why economic institutions and their ownership and\ngovernance structures differ across countries.\n\n6.\n\nEvaluate CEO pay structures and their incentive effects.\n\n7.\n\nExplain how to evaluate the relationship between governance and performance.\n\n8.\n\nAddress practical questions such as: contracting out, contract design,\norganisational architecture, the level and composition of CEO pay, the size and\nstructure of boards and their committees, the value of non-voting shares, mixed\nmodel ownership (i.e., listed companies with some government ownership) and\nMaori organisations.\n\nContent Outline\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nThe Problem of Coordinating Effort to Create and Capture Value\nOrganising Transactions and Firm Boundaries\nOrganisational Architecture and Management Control\nEconomic Institutions and Performance\nRemuneration: Incentives, Focus and Politics\nBoard structure and other governance metrics\nPaper Presentations.\n\n\fInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the course coordinator.\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThis course consists of twelve 180-minute sessions convened weekly.

The remaining sessions introduce,\nevaluate and discuss contemporary governance issues, while at the same time continuing\nto develop a rigorous framework for evaluating governance issues.

Work generally has gaps. Frequently work of\nthis grade takes a simple factual approach and understanding and coverage of\nmaterial is inadequate; does not attempt to interpret the material; at the lower\nend, indicates a need for considerable effort to achieve improvement;\ncommunication and presentation skills are poor.\nHighly unsatisfactory. Work shows a lack of knowledge about and understanding\nof the topic. Inadequate in degree of relevance, sometimes completeness,\nsometimes both. Communication and presentation skills are weak.\n\n4\n\n\fUniversity Policy on Academic Integrity\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat,\nand views cheating in coursework as a serious academic offence. The work that a\nstudent submits for grading must be the student\u2019s own work, reflecting his or her\nlearning. Where work from other sources is used, it must be properly\nacknowledged and referenced. This requirement also applies to sources on the\nworld-wide web. A student\u2019s assessed work may be reviewed against electronic\nsource material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable\nrequest, students may be required to provide an electronic version of their work\nfor computerised review.\nPlagiarism\nIn academic writing, all sources of information other than your own ideas must be\nappropriately acknowledged in the body of the text and in a reference list at the\nend of the essay. Failure to do so is plagiarism, which is a form of cheating and is\nconsidered a serious matter. Students are encouraged to work collaboratively\nwith others and this is an important part of the University experience. This\ncollaboration may take the form of exchanging ideas, circulating readings and\nproducing notes. However, beyond this point, the student\u2019s written work in\nassignments should be written independently and reflect the student\u2019s own\nunderstanding of the topic. In the case of two students handing in very similar or\nidentical work, both students will be penalised.\nWhile students are expected to consult expert opinion, particularly in the form of\njournals and books, in the completion of their assignments, such opinion must be\nacknowledged by explicit reference to the work consulted. If in any doubt about\nthese issues, talk with your lecturer to clarify your concerns.\nPenalties for Plagiarism\nThe penalties for plagiarism are severe and can range from gaining no marks for\nthe assignment work in the paper concerned to disciplinary action under the\nterms of the Examination Regulations.\nThis is a paper where well-researched thought and argument are encouraged. We\nurge you to make the most of this opportunity.\n\n5\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/INFOSYS110.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nINFOSYS 110: BUSINESS SYSTEMS (15 POINTS)\nSEMESTER 2 (1175)\n__________________________________________________________\nCourse Prescription\nExplores how information systems and operations management help organisations\nto innovate, optimise, and deliver value.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\n\n\facknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment.

This qualitative data, which is administered, collected and collated by the\nProgramme Office, is designed as an \u2018early warning\u2019 system of any significant issues with\nthe course that might need addressing quickly.\nLecturers are asked to provide a brief report to the Director GSM MBA on key items\nidentified and proposed actions. Lecturers are also asked to provide a verbal report to\nthe class, proposing any solutions as appropriate.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nThe University of Auckland evaluates the quality of teaching and of courses by using the\nthe Summative Evaluation Tool, or SET. Summative evaluation is formal, summative\nevaluation of teaching undertaken according to University policy and is conducted at the\nend of a semester/quarter through the use of the formal University SET instruments.\nSummative evaluation is used by teachers to reflect on their teaching practice, and is\nalso used by the University for quality assurance of teaching and courses..\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSINESS710.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nBUSINESS 710: RESEARCH DESIGN (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\nCourse Prescription\n\nFocuses on the principles and practices of scholarly work and what it means to conduct\nresearch.

You should read the following carefully and\nthen decide whether you would like to take this course in the first semester or\nthe second semester.\nSemester 1 course delivery approach:\nTeaching consists of weekly lectures (covering 2 topics each), delivered in class by\nthe lecturer. Lectures will be recorded and will be made available on-line (although do\nbe aware that the recording technology may occasionally fail). This is augmented by\nweekly workshops in which students attempt questions in class, along with\nexplanations by the tutor. Workshops are recorded and will be made available on-line.\nSemester 2 course delivery approach:\nWeekly lectures and workshops, as recorded during the first semester, will be made\navailable to students on-line at the start of the course. Class time will be structured as\ninformal question-and-answers sessions. The first weekly session will be hosted by\nthe lecturer and will focus on conceptual questions related to the material covered in\nthe course. The second weekly session will be hosted by the tutor and will focus on\nissues encountered in solving workshop problems.\n\nLectures presented by lecturer in class\nWorkshops presented by tutor in class\nRecorded lectures available online\nRecorded workshops available online\nLecture question and answer sessions in class*\nWorkshop question and answer sessions in class*\nLecture notes available on-line\nWorkshop questions available on-line\n\nSemester 1\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\n\nSemester 2\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n* Question and answer sessions are not recorded.\nThe course content and assessment remains the same for both semesters. In both\nsemesters attendance at class is optional. However, carefully reading the lecture notes\nand required readings are mandatory. Listening to lectures (either in class or online)\nand working though problem sets yourself are also mandatory. (Mandatory means it\nis part of the course and you should do it. But we won\u2019t police it.)\nBottom-line: Choose semester 1 if you prefer a traditional class-room based\nexperience where the lecturer and tutor do the talking. Choose semester 2 if you like\nthe freedom to structure your time and learning as it suits you and if you would like to\nhave the occasional chat with the lecturer and/or tutor.\n\n3\n\n\fClass times and locations:\nFirst class (Lectures): 1pm to 3pm on Mondays in MLT 2\nSecond class (Workshops): 1pm to 3pm on Fridays in MLT 2\nTeaching Staff\nLecturer: Dr Paul Geertsema\nOffice hours: 11am to 1pm on Mondays (appointment needed)\nOffice: OGGB 575\nEmail: p.geertsema@auckland.ac.nz\nTutor: Diamond Wang\nHelp Desk: Location TBC\nHelp Desk Hours: TBC (appointment needed)\nEmail: diamond.wang@auckland.ac.nz\nLearning Resources\nThe required textbook for this paper is:\nInvestments, by Bodie, Kane and Marcus, 10th edition, Prentice Hall, Inc.\nYou must have a textbook. It is acceptable to use the 9th, 8th, 7th, or even the 6th\nedition.\nAlso highly recommended is:\nInvestment Valuation: Tools and techniques for determining the value of any asset, by\nAswath Damodaran, 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons Inc.\nWe will use this text for the equity valuation part of the course.\nIn addition to the material in the textbooks, I will also make available additional\nreadings on on-line. All additional reading material is examinable unless explicitly\nindicated otherwise.\n\n4\n\n\fAssessment\nThe assignments, the mid-term test and the final exam assess your ability to\ndemonstrate your understanding of the learning outcomes. Your final grade is\ncomposed of the following weightings:\nAssignment 1\nAssignment 2\nMid-term Test\nFinal Exam\n\n5%\n15%\n20%\n60%\n\n\u201cPlussage\u201d applies to the mid-term test. If your grade in the final exam is higher than\nyour grade in the mid-term test, your final exam grade will replace your mid-term test\ngrade.\nOverall_course_grade = (MAX(Midterm_test, Final_exam) * 20%) +\n(Final_exam * 60%) + (Assignment_1 * 5%) + (Assignment _2 * 15%)\nThis also means the mid-term test is optional (but highly recommended). If you do not\nsit the mid-term test, your final exam grade will automatically become your mid-term\ngrade. There won\u2019t be a make-up mid-term test in case you cannot sit the mid-term\ntest.\nBoth the mid-term test and the final exam will be OPEN BOOK. This means you\ncan bring any written material to the test and the exam, including text books and\nlecture notes.\nBoth the mid-term test and the final exam are RESTRICTED CALCULATOR. You\nmay only use a standard scientific calculator. An example of a complying\ncalculator is the CASIO FX-82 (or similar).\nStudents must normally obtain a passing grade in the final exam in order to pass the\ncourse.\nLearning\nOutcome\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nAssignment 1\n\nAssignment 2\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\nx\n\nMid Term Test\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nFinal Exam\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nAssignments should be submitted in the manner detailed in the assignment; it is\nanticipated that we will use an on-line submission method. It is your responsibility to\nensure that you submit assignments on time.\n\n5\n\n\fInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face- toface and/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\nStudent Feedback\nStudents may be asked to complete evaluations (course, teaching, tutoring) at the end\nof the course.\nBut why wait? If you have a concern, feel free to discuss it with the lecturer, tutor or\nclass representative. We can only do something about a problem if we know about it!\nPlagiarism/Cheating\nYou should only hand in your own work in assignments. Where you use material\nsourced from elsewhere (even if \u201cre-worded\u201d), you should cite it using the APA\nconvention. Do ensure that you are familiar with the Student Academic Conduct\nStatute. (See https://cdn.auckland.ac.nz/assets/central/about/the-university/how-theuniversity-works/policy-and-administration/Supervision/student-academic-conductstatute.pdf).

The first will be completed in Week 4.\nIt will consist of a moot or submission on issues given to students beforehand\nconcerning a realistic legal dispute involving negligence. Each group will\npresent arguments/submissions concerning a different litigant in the dispute.\nAssessment will be based on various criteria notified beforehand, such as\nidentification of issues, identification of relevant legal principles and the\napplication of the principles to the facts.\nThe second team-based assignment will be during week 9. This will consist of\nparticipating in role playing at a shareholder meeting. Each team will cooperate or work in competition with other teams (depending on the goals each\nis seeking to advance) by voting at a shareholder meeting to achieve results or\nblock other shareholder groups from achieving theirs.

Weeks where assessments are due will almost inevitably require more.\nThe lectures provide the basic content structure for the course. In the Tutorials and TBL\nsessions, you will develop your thinking about the topics canvassed in the lectures and\nseek to clarify those aspects that you are unclear about. There are high expectations that\nyou will come prepared to discuss, argue, debate, and otherwise participate in the Tutorial\nand TBL class activities.\n\nTeaching Staff\nDr Keith Macky (CFHRINZ)\nPrincipal Lecturer\nEmail: keith.macky@auckland.ac.nz\n\nDr Audrea Warner\nProfessional Teaching Fellow\nEmail: audrea.warner@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\nThere is no textbook for this course although you will be directed to readings to extend\nyour knowledge of the topics introduced in the lectures.\nThat said, the main books that will be referred to are:\n\n\fDowling, P.J., Festing, M., & Engle, A.D.

As a general principle, the knowledge\nand information published in the academic journal literature can be trusted as valid and\nreliable sources, and certainly more so than some opinion piece you find via an open\ninternet search. There are, of course, useful sources of knowledge other than lectures,\ntextbooks and academic journal articles.

If you have been\ngranted special examination conditions, please make the teaching staff aware of these at\nthe beginning of the quarter so the appropriate arrangements can be made.\nStudent Feedback\nFeedback is sought from students to shape and improve the course. You will be asked to\ncomplete a formative fast feedback questionnaire early in the quarter and a more formal\nevaluation of teaching and the course towards the end.\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments.

The key goals of this\ncourse are:\n1. To introduce the concept of co-creating customer value, and using this concept to gain\ncompetitive advantage.\n2. To introduce the key elements of marketing strategy and practice and explain their\ntheoretical underpinnings.\n3. To provide a general approach for analysing marketing situations and developing\nstrategic and tactical marketing plans.\n4. To provide a broad understanding of what drives marketing activity within industries\nand organisations, and to recognise key features of marketing initiatives.\n\n\fLearning Outcomes\nUpon completion of this course it is expected that students will be able to:\n1. Understand key elements of marketing, and how they interact.\n2. Assess dynamic marketing situations and develop appropriate strategic and tactical\nresponses.\n3. Find and evaluate relevant information for marketing decision-making.\n4. Apply marketing principles to develop appropriate marketing strategies for specific\nsituations and organisations.\n5.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\n\fDetailed Information on Written Assignments\nIndividual Assignment: Co-Creating Value\nThe focus of this course is using marketing approaches to create value for a range of\nstakeholders, including the marketer\u2019s organisation, channel intermediaries, end\ncustomers, and other affected parties. A key part of this focus is the idea of co-creating\nvalue: we cannot create value for another, but we can work with them to build value\nperceptions together. This individual assignment asks you to consider a marketplace\noffering, existing or new, and approaches you could use to foster value co-creation.\nTasks:\n1. Select a brand, product, service, idea or person(s). You may use an existing\nentity, or choose to focus on a new venture. Explain the key features of your\nchosen offering.\n2. Discuss the target audiences.\n3. What are the target audience wants and needs? Note: in many cases, the target\nmay not fully understand their wants and needs, or may be unable to articulate\ntheir desires. You will need to tease these issues apart to form a supportable\npoint of view.\n4. How will you position your offering?\n5. Explain the approaches and strategies you will use to co-create value.\n6. Give an honest assessment of the strengths, weaknesses and likely outcomes of\nyour approach.\n\nLength:\n\n3000 words, \u00b110%\n\nFormat: paper submission, with a .pdf version also submitted via Canvas\nDue date: Session 3, 17 November, at beginning of class\nAssessment weighting: 35% of final grade\n\n\fGroup Assignment: Applying Marketing Approaches\nThe marketing discipline offers a useful lens for examining issues. It can provide a way to\nframe problems, a base of theories for understanding the internal workings of the problem,\nand a set of tools that can be applied to make appropriate improvements. This group\nassignment asks you to consider these facets of marketing in an integrated way.\nTasks\n1. Develop a group of 2 to 3 persons to work on the assignment.\n2. Select a major business, governmental or societal issue or problem.\n3. Explain the key features of the issue or problem.\n4. State the major (and perhaps minor) aspects of the problem that have\nmarketing implications.\n5. Suggest the areas or aspects of the issue that marketing tools and insights can fix\nor improve.\n6. Assuming you have scarce resources (money, people, and perhaps time), develop\na ranked priority list of the marketing actions you would take.\n7. Provide an assessment of the level of change and success you might expect from\ntaking these actions.\nLength:\n\n2500-3000 carefully chosen words\n\nFormat:\n\npaper submission, with a .pdf version also submitted via Canvas\n\nDue Date: Session 5, November, at beginning of class\nAssessment weighting: 30% of final grade\nPlease note: many of the most important problems facing the world are complex and may\nseem intractable. A large and difficult issue that can yield only minor improvements may\nbe much more important than a simple problem in which marketing can achieve great\nsuccess. Consider choosing a problem that is interesting and important, even if it is not\neasy.\n\n\fFinal Take-Home Test: Synthesising the Course\nThe final take-home test is designed to provide useful revision, and help you synthesise\nthe themes of the course. Questions are in short essay format. Referring to concepts we\nhave covering in the course is required, but formal references are not expected.\nThe test will contain one required question. In addition you will answer 2 more questions\nchosen from 4 options.\nLength:\n\n1000 carefully chosen words for Question 1 plus\n500 words each for Questions 2 & 3: 200 words in total.\n\nFormat:\n\nelectronic submission via Canvas\n\nDue Date: Friday 24 November, 5:00pm\nAssessment weighting: 35% of final grade\n\nAssessment\n(example)\nIndividual Report: Marketing Assessment\nGroup Report: Board Paper\nTake-Home Test\n\n25%\n25%\n50%\n____\n\nTotal\n\n100%\n\nMinimum requirement to pass the course: 50% overall aggregated marks.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt about\nhow to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student Learning\nCentre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further information\nabout academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\n\n\fThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\nAssignment Submission\nAll assignments for this course should be submitted through the Assignments section of\nthese course webpages, after going through the standard review process. This process is\nas follows:\n1. assignment draft is run through Grammarly\n2. Grammarly report and assignment draft are submitted to the assignment draft\npoint for language, grammar and structure review and feedback by the Business\nCommunication team, and for originality checking. This draft point will close no\nlater than 24 hours before the assignment submission deadline\n3. final assignment, which incorporates the Business Communication team feedback\non language and originality, is submitted to the final submission point\nThe draft and final submission points can be found in the Assignments section of these\nwebpages.\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions, the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/PROPERTY773.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2016\nPROPERTY 773: GIS and Property Analysis (15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1165)\n\nCourse Prescription\nThe increasing availability of geographically referenced property data offers significant potential\nfor property research and modelling.

Business Systems Analysis introduces systems\ndevelopment process concepts and activities, with a strong focus on understanding\nthe problem and solution through modelling.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: INFOSYS 110 or INFOSYS 120 or INFOMGMT 192 or COMPSCI 105\nRestriction: INFOMGMT 291\n\nGoals of the Course\nThe overall course objective is to promote the conceptual and skill based learning\nneeded to understand the process of analysing and designing information systems\nfrom the perspective of a Business Systems Analyst (BSA). A BSA works with the\nbusiness to understand their multi-faceted needs. While a BSA\u2019s speciality and focus\nis the business\u2019 needs related to information systems, a holistic approach is necessary\nto deliver a sustainable and long-term solution that delivers value. This course\nconcentrates on the front-end of the systems development process; that is, the\nanalysis process. The analysis process provides a strong basis for understanding and\nmodelling the user needs in an information system solution. The course therefore\ntouches on project planning and management aspects, as well as the design of\ncomputer programs in order to provide an overview of the whole information system\ndevelopment process. The development of skills is stimulated through course readings\nand lectures, practice in lectures, laboratories and assignments, and through\ninteraction with the teaching team. In the final project, students will work in teams to\npractise the major steps and techniques in the whole information systems\ndevelopment process: from gathering information through to design, implementation,\nand documentation of the implemented system.\n\n\fLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. describe the different Information Systems development methodologies, and the\nrespective people, cultural, technical and business considerations involved in\nchoosing an appropriate Information System;\n2. identify the major activities and deliverables involved in each phase of a basic system\ndevelopment lifecycle (SDLC);\n3. perform the major activities involved in the analysis phase of a basic system\ndevelopment lifecycle (SDLC) \u2013 applying appropriate strategies and techniques to\nunderstand and meet the multi-faceted needs of a customer;\n4. demonstrate familiarity with the set of typical tasks and techniques used by Business\nSystems Analysts to design an information systems solution to meet business\nrequirements, such as reading and creating simple models to design a solution;\n5. analyse a business problem or opportunity and develop an appropriate strategy to\ndeliver a feasible, long-term, sustainable and value adding solution;\n6. produce the requisite systems documentation at each point in the analysis of an\ninformation system, and to do so with clarity and completeness;\n7. design and develop a user interface; and\n8. work as a team to identify and apply the basics of project management.\n\nContent Outline\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\n\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n\nIntroduction to Business Systems Analysis and the SDLC\nPlanning phase techniques\nAnalysis phase techniques\nAnalysis phase modelling\nAnalysis phase modelling\nAnalysis phase modelling\nDesign phase techniques\nDesign phase techniques\nImplementation phase considerations\nImplementation phase considerations\nOperations and Maintenance phase considerations\nAgile methodologies\n\nAn exact lecture-by-lecture outline will be provided during semester.\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThe course is delivered in three one-hour lectures and one two-hour laboratory each\nweek. Laboratories are tutored sessions where techniques and concepts discussed in\nlectures are put into practice. These sessions are an essential part of this course and\nattendance is strongly recommended. In addition, students will be expected to read\nand work on assignments/tests/self-revision for a minimum of five hours per week.\nThe course uses case studies as a basis for practice in lectures, laboratories, and\nassessments.\nIn the first week of lectures, assessment and other procedures related to the course\nwill be clarified. Lecture outlines, additional information and announcements will be\nmade available on Canvas during the course of the semester as necessary.\n\n\fTeaching Staff\nJosephine Lee\nLecturer\nOffice: OGGB 466\nEmail: jyt.lee@auckland.ac.nz\nPhone extension: 82435\n\nKhushbu Tilvawala\nLecturer\nOffice: OGGB 428\nEmail: k.tilvawala@auckland.ac.nz\nPhone extension: 81529\n\nAngel Yu Wei Hsu\nCourse Coordinator\nOffice: OGGB 428\nEmail: y.hsu@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\nCanvas is the primary location for material, information, and interaction between\nstudents and the teaching team and other students.\nLightly Recommended Text: Dennis, A., Wixom, B.

The hypotheses can\ndeal with accounting, marketing, information systems, or management theories \u2013\nwhatever your discipline is.\nThe hypotheses must reflect that your study is a\nbehavioural study, which involves constructs such as attitudes, perceptions, values,\npersonalities, behavioural intentions and behaviours. Other non-behavioural constructs\nsuch as performance measures can also be included. The hypotheses must be based on\na careful, exhaustive review and analysis of published literature. That analysis will also\n\n3\n\n\fcontain a comprehensive methodological critique of existing literature using the\nprincipals we cover in class.\nSubmissions should include traditional Literature Review, Conceptual Analysis, and\nHypotheses sections. The Literature Review and Conceptual Analysis can be brief for the\npurpose of this submission. Your submission must also contain a complete Methods\nsection. This section must include all of the important choices you made about how to\nconduct your research, and the corresponding rationales for those choices. It must also\ninclude most of the details of your proposed procedure. The methods should be spelled\nout so clearly that another graduate student could pick up your work and know how to\ncarry out your research. Following the Methods, your submission must contain an\nAnalysis section as a substitute for the typical Results section. In this section, you\nshould carefully describe how you will analyze the data from your research design in a\nway that clearly tests your hypotheses.\nAll submissions must be prepared according to the dissertation format prescribed by the\nGraduate School.

Concepts of game theory will be systematically\nintroduced and applied to study strategic firm behaviour in a variety of general and more\nindustry-specific market settings. In each case, we will analyse the implications of the\nmarket behaviour for consumers and society and explore the potential role for public\npolicy with instruments like regulation, competition policy and patent policy.\nProgramme and Course Advice\nThe background of basic microeconomics (at ECON 301 Advanced Microeconomics) and\nbasic industrial organization (ECON 304 Firms and Markets) is required for this course,\nand the basic knowledge of game theory (at ECON 701 Microeconomic Theory level) is\nalso important for understanding the models. Please make sure that you are wellequipped with the above required knowledge before enrolling this course.\nSuccessful completion of this course enables students to read and understand the most\nrecent research papers, write a dissertation in the field and become a successful\nconsultant, industry analyst or policy advisor. Students with an interest in policy issues\nshould consider taking the closely related course ECON 782 Regulation and Competition\nPolicy.\nGoals of the Course\nThe goal of this course is to equip students with an understanding of the functioning of\nimperfectly competitive markets, which they will find useful in subsequent employment,\nother postgraduate courses or research. This topics course aims to provide the most\nrecent industrial organisation (IO) theory to enable students to better understand and\nevaluate market outcomes in a variety of different industry settings.\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will:\n1.\n\nbe familiar with modern theories and their recent developments;\n\n2.\n\nbe able to understand and analyse the interdependence of market structures, firm\nbehaviour and market outcomes;\n\n3.\n\nbe familiar with more advanced game theory tools and their applications;\n\n4.\n\nknow how to apply game theory tools to analyse market situations involving vertical\nrelations;\n\n5.\n\nbe able to critically evaluate anti-competitive conduct under different market\nstructures;\n\n6.\n\nbe able to understand basic ideas of competition policy and regulation.\n\nContinued\n\n\f2.\n\nECON 702 Course Outline 2015\n\nContent Outline\nWeek 1\n\nIntroduction and Firm Theory\n\nWeek 2\n\nMonopoly and Dominant Firms\n\nWeek 3\n\nOligopoly\n\nWeek 4\n\nPrice Discrimination\n\nWeek 5\n\nProduct Differentiation\n\nWeek 6\n\nCollusion and Cartel\n\nWeek 7\n\nVertical Relations; Presentation 1 & 2\n\nWeek 8\n\nTying and Bundling; Presentation 3 & 4\n\nWeek 9\n\nPredation and Exclusion; Presentation 5 & 6\n\nWeek 10\n\nRetailer Market Power; Presentation 7 & 8\n\nWeek 11\n\nHorizontal Mergers; Presentation 9 & 10\n\nWeek 12\n\nMilk Markets in New Zealand; Presentation 11 & 12\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThis course will be taught in the first semester and will have a total of 36 lecture contact\nhours.

These papers, as\nselected in the syllabus, are the \u201cclassical\u201d research outcomes published in top journals\nincluding the American Economic Review and the Rand Journal of Economics, which\nprovide significant contributions to IO theory. Students are required to read and review\nthe assigned papers in detail and prepare slides for presentation.\nA typical presentation consists of three parts: an introduction, which gives the audience\na brief idea of the motivation and the contribution of the paper; followed by the main\ncontents which would include a simplified model and the main results; and finally, the\npresenter should summarize and give a brief comment on the paper, including the\nlimitations and potential extensions. Ideally the presenter would also examine the recent\nliterature on their topic following that \u201cclassical\u201d paper.\nEach presentation has a time limit of 20 minutes, and presenters are expected to deliver\nthe basic ideas of the paper as well as their own comments. An ideal allocation of time\nwould consist of 5 minutes for the introduction, 10 minutes for the main contents, and 5\nminutes for the summary and conclusion.\nStudents are also required to write a summary and review report for the presented\npaper, based on their presentation slides, and the summary must be handed in before\nthe end of week 12. This exercise is very important for building research capability.\nLearning\nOutcome\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nTest 1\n\nTest 2\n\nAssignment\n\nPresentation\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n___________________\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/INTBUS201.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nINTBUS 201: FOUNDATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS\n(15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCourse Prescription\n\nExplores the distinctive nature of international business, the internationalisation of\nbusiness and the interactions among the various actors in international business.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\nPrerequisite: BUSINESS 102, or MGMT 101 and ECON 101 and 111, or 191\nRestrictions: INTBUS 210, 211\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nThe study of international business is situated at the intersection between business and\nthe international system.

(Some restrictions\napply, please refer to the Business Student Centre for details.)\n\nGoals of the Course\nEconomics is not a collection of facts to be written down and memorised. Economics is a\nway of thinking about the world \u2013 and the world is always changing. Economists have\ndeveloped a set of simple but widely applicable concepts and principles that are useful for\nunderstanding economic situations ranging from decisions that individuals make every day\nto decisions made by firms and governments in complex markets. The objective of this\ncourse is to help students learn and understand these concepts and principles and to apply\nthem to a variety of economic situations.\n\n\f2\n\nECON 191 Course Outline 2017\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1.\n\nunderstand and apply supply and demand analysis to relevant economic issues;\n\n2.\n\napply marginal analysis to the \u201cfirm\u201d under different market conditions;\n\n3.\n\nunderstand the causes and consequences of different market structures;\n\n4.\n\napply economic models to examine current economic issues and evaluate policy\noptions for addressing these issues;\n\n5.\n\nanalyse the causes and effects of changes in real GDP;\n\n6.\n\nunderstand the concept of macroeconomic equilibrium and implications for the\nmanagement of the business cycle;\n\n7.\n\nidentify and explain changes in the money supply and analyse the effects of monetary\npolicy changes on the New Zealand economy; and\n\n8.\n\nanalyse the importance of international trade to the New Zealand economy and\nevaluate the effects of government policy measures on the exchange rate and trade.\n\nContent Outline\nMicroeconomics (8 weeks)\nMicroeconomics deals with the economic behaviour of consumers and firms within an\neconomy. The framework developed is used to examine and evaluate the operation of the\nmarket mechanism for various market structures and to evaluate the impact of intervention\nthrough public policy on economic efficiency and income distribution.\nWeek 1:\nWeek 2:\nWeek 3:\nWeek 4:\nWeek 5\nWeek 6:\nWeek 7:\nWeek 8:\n\nIntroduction and preliminary concepts\nDemand, Supply and Market Equilibrium\nElasticity and applications\nApplications of the Demand and Supply Model\nThe Choice Problem; Production and Costs\nPerfectly Competitive Markets\nImperfectly Competitive Markets; Monopoly and Monopolistic Competition\nOligopoly and Game Theory\n\nMacroeconomics (4 weeks)\nMacroeconomics examines how economies function in aggregate.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing:\nwww.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\n\n\fThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed\n\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\nAssignment Submission\nAll assignments for this course should be submitted through the Assignments section of\nthese course webpages, after going through the standard review process. This process is\nas follows:\n1. assignment draft is run through Grammarly\n2.

This approach emphasises both individual and team\ncapabilities. The course also has an online component, called Workshop Preparation, that\nguides students, each week, to complete tasks in preparation for their weekly workshop.\nEach week you will attend a Weekly Workshop that lasts for two hours. This takes place\nin a specially designed team learning laboratory, in classes of about 100 students.\nDuring the first week of the course, you will be formed into teams that will remain\ntogether for the duration of the semester. Each team normally comprises seven\nstudents. There is no requirement for you to meet or work as a team outside of the\nscheduled weekly workshop times.\nFollowing screening, you may be invited to attend additional academic skills tutorials.\nThese tutorials are designed to build academic and language skills and will help you to\nsucceed in your studies. Even without an invitation to attend you are very welcome to\noptionally choose to attend these tutorials to enhance your academic skills.\nIt is expected that you will spend about 10 hours per week on this course:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nUp to three to four hours each week will be spent in online Workshop Preparation.\nTwo hours will be spent in your Weekly Workshop.\nFor those who are invited or chosen to attend academic skills tutorials, up to two\nhours will be spent each week attending your tutorial.\nThe remaining time, on average about two to four hours for a typical student, will\nbe used for individual study e.g. consolidating notes, preparing for tests etc.\n\nTeaching Staff\nCourse Director: Professor Natasha Hamilton-Hart\nCourse Coordinator: Dr Parizad Mulla\nTeaching Staff: A team of workshop facilitators is involved in BUSINESS 101. Two\nfacilitators will be managing each stream of approximately 100 students. You will be\nintroduced to your facilitators during your first weekly workshop. Those two facilitators\nwill then be your first and primary contact point for course support throughout the\nsemester. Each of your facilitators will hold office hours each week for students in your\nparticular stream so that you can go to them with questions or concerns.\n\nLearning Resources\nUsing the University\u2019s learning management system, Canvas, you can log into the course\nsite for BUSINESS 101. You will be able to access from here all official course information\nand course policies, follow your week-by-week Workshop Preparation tasks and link to the\nPiazza online platform that we use for course communication.\nThe Workshop Preparation learning resources, accessible online, each week, through Cecil,\nwill include readings, video clips, quizzes and an online weekly quiz that counts towards\nyour final grade.

Its coverage includes trade issues arising in connection both with\nmodern developments such as the increasing role of global value chains and the spread of the\ndigital economy, and with older problems of ongoing importance to New Zealand such as the\npersistence of serious barriers to agricultural trade. The course addresses issues and problems\nrelated both to the system of multilateral trade rules developed through the GATT and WTO,\nand to the spread of preferential trade agreements such as free trade areas, as well as examples\nof deeper integration such as the European Union and the economic relationship between\nAustralia and New Zealand. Consideration will be given to the implications for both New\nZealand and regional and global trade of recent developments such as Brexit and the changes\nin U.S. trade policy foreshadowed by the Trump administration, as well as the rise of\nprotectionism more generally. Issues that have been especially controversial in recent trade\nnegotiations will also be covered, for example investment and investor-state dispute\nsettlement, inclusion in trade agreements of provisions on intellectual property (including\nimplications for public health), the relation between trade policy and environmental policy,\nand trade and labour standards.\nProgramme and Course Advice\nThe course aims to provide an in-depth understanding of trade policy and its current\ncontroversies, both for economics majors and graduate students of public policy.\nRelevant economic concepts and ideas, including the basic economic analysis of international\ntrade, will be presented in a non-technical format. Suggestions for additional readings can be\nprovided before and during the course for students needing to deepen their understanding of\nthese ideas and concepts. Students with a limited background in economics should consult the\nlecturer prior to enrolment.\nGoals of the Course\nThe goal of the course is to provide students with a detailed understanding of the key\ndevelopments and policy issues in modern international trade, taking into account relevant\neconomic analysis, rules, norms and agreements governing modern international trade, the\nimpact on trade policy of new developments in international trade, and the challenges\nconfronting established frameworks for trade policy.\n\n\f2.\n\nECON 742 Course Outline 2017\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1.

The class size is over\n300 students. The lectures are formally presented by staff active in research. There are also\nworkshops to help students revise and consolidate concepts, and provide problem-solving\ntechniques. There are 6 one-hour long tutorials (up to 16 people per group) worth 6% in the\nfinal grade. Tutorials are held in an informal setting to give students the opportunity to discuss\npre-advised questions with their peers and tutor. Students must come fully prepared for these\ntutorials and are expected to participate in class discussions. Marks will be awarded, at the\ntutor\u2019s discretion, based on the quality of the individual student\u2019s contribution and level of\npreparation for all six tutorials. Additionally students must participate fully in preparing and\nmarking three assignments which are peer assessed under the online AROPA system. These\nassignments will be worth 9% of the final grade.\n\nTeaching Staff\nJohn Ren\nAcademic Course Director\nOffice: OGGB 688\nTel: 373-7599 (Ext 86153)\nEmail: j.ren@auckland.ac.nz\nNadia Dabee\nCourse Coordinator\nOffice: OGGB 662\nTel: 373-7599 (Ext 81941)\nEmail: n.dabee@auckland.ac.nz\n\n\fOther Teaching staff:\nMark MacConnell: mark.macconnell@auckland.ac.nz\nSophie Maclaren: s.maclaren@auckland.ac.nz\nPhilip Cook: p.cook@auckland.ac.nz\nBarnard Hutchinson: b.hutchinson@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\nSet Textbook:\nJ W Carter and John Ren, Carter\u2019s Guide to New Zealand Contract Law (2016, LexisNexis)\nRecommended text:\nBurrows, Finn & Todd, Law of Contract in New Zealand (5th edition, 2015 LexisNexis\nButterworths)\nThese textbooks are available at the Davis Law Library and the Kate Edgar Information Commons\n(Level 1)\n\nAssessment\n\nTest: Assessment of learning outcomes 1, 2 and 3\nTutorials and online assessment (AROPA)\nFinal Exam (2 hours)\n\n25%\n15%\n60%\n\nTotal\n\n100%\n\nFurther details on these assessments will be provided in the course book and at our first lecture.\nThe broad relationship between these assessments and the course learning outcomes is as\nfollows:\nLearning Outcome\n\nTest (25%)\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nTutorial and AROPA\nparticipation (15%)\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nFinal\nExam (60%)\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nThere is no plussage for this course.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\n\fThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available\nat: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\nAssignment Submission\nAll assignments for this course should be submitted through the Assignments section of\nthese course webpages, after going through the standard review process. This process is\nas follows:\n1. assignment draft is run through Grammarly\n2. Grammarly report and assignment draft are submitted to the assignment draft point\nfor language, grammar and structure review and feedback by the Business\nCommunication team, and for originality checking. This draft point will close no later\nthan 24 hours before the assignment submission deadline\n3. final assignment, which incorporates the Business Communication team feedback on\nlanguage and originality, is submitted to the final submission point\nThe draft and final submission points can be found in the Assignments section of these\nwebpages.\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year.

In particular, students will:\n1. be able to apply the mathematics of constrained optimisation (especially Lagrange's\nmethod) to solve microeconomic problems; and\n2. be familiar with the basics of duality theory.\nDecision-making under uncertainty is especially important to many applications of\nmicroeconomic theory, so students will:\n3. develop a thorough understanding of the expected utility model, and become familiar\nwith its uses in economic analysis.\nStudents will learn how to:\n4. work with the general equilibrium framework;\n5. identify Pareto optimal allocations; and\n6. compute equilibrium prices.\nIt is also important that students:\n7. become familiar with the basic Welfare Theorems.\n\n\f2.\n\nECON 701 Course Outline 2016\n\nLearning Outcomes continued\nThe rest of the course will cover more recent ideas. Students will:\n8. acquire a basic toolkit from game theory;\n9. develop skills in the translation of economic problems into game-theoretic notation;\n10. be able to select an appropriate solution concept; and\n11. be able to compute equilibrium strategies.\nStudents will develop a thorough understanding of:\n12. the basic moral hazard problem, its extensions and applications; and\n13. the basic adverse selection problem, its extensions and applications.\n\nContent Outline\nThe following is an approximate guide only:\nWeeks 1-3:\nDecision-making by consumers and firms\nWeek 4:\nChoices under uncertainty\nWeeks 5-6:\nMarkets, welfare and equilibrium\nWeeks 7-9:\nGame theory: solution concepts for normal and extensive forms\nWeeks 10-12: Contract Theory and Information Economics\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThis course will be taught in the first semester.\nExpected class size is around\n35 students. There will be 3 hours of lectures per week. There will also be one tutorial\nsession offered each week (Thursday, 10.00am to 11.00am) to review lecture material.\n\nTeaching Staff\nAssociate Professor John Hillas\nOffice: OGGB 6111\nTel: 923 7349\nEmail: j.hillas@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\nPrescribed Text:\nG.A.

Topics include\ntransformational, charismatic, follower-centric, cross-cultural, critical, spiritual and\nshared/distributed leadership as well as issues that relate strongly to leadership such as\ngender, ethics and development.\n\nGoals of the Course\nLeadership is an area of study that has always occupied a central position within the field\nof Organisational Behaviour. In the past decade leadership has become an even more\npopular and significant topic to study and to research. This has been driven, in part, by a\nworld-wide interest and belief that sound leadership can address all manner of problems\nand improve performance both within and outside organizations. In response to this\nwidespread public interest, a growing number of academics from a wide range of\ndisciplines are now actively engaged in researching leadership. This course will provide a\nsurvey of some of the most researched leadership topics in order to develop students\u2019\nunderstanding of the issues surrounding leadership and its research. In-class experiences\nwill aim to help students in developing their abilities to think and reflect about their role\nas a leader and a follower in new and different ways.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that students will be able to:\n\u2022 L.O.1 Demonstrate their understanding of the major theories and conceptions of\nleadership\n\u2022 L.O.2 Explain the critical debates as well as the primary areas of agreement and\ndisagreement within the leadership literature\n\u2022 L.O.3 Evaluate and develop their abilities as leadership researchers\n\u2022 L.O.4 Critically apply leadership theories and concepts to diverse empirical\ncontexts\n\u2022 L.O.5 Apply the concepts of leadership to their own experience in a reflective\nmanner\n\n\fContent Outline\nWeek\n1\n\nDate\nWeek of 18/7\n\n2\n\nWeek of 25/7\n\n3\n4\n5\n\nWeek of 1/8\nWeek of 8/8\nWeek of 15/8\n\n6\n\nWeek of 22/8\nMid-semester break\n\n7\n\nWeek of 12/9\n\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\nWeek\n\nof\nof\nof\nof\nof\n\n19/9\n26/9\n3/10\n10/10\n17/10\n\nTopic\nIntroduction: Syllabus; how to read a case;\nappreciating research\nCharismatic/transformational and authentic\nleadership\nContingency and dyadic perspectives\nNo class: Critiques due next week\nLeadership and power\nCritique 1 due\nLeadership and decision making\n\nLeadership and networks\nCritique 2 due\nEmergent / shared leadership\nLeading change\nLeadership development\nFollowership\nIndividual presentations\nLeadership project due\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nThe class will meet for three hours each week.

Summative feedback will be\ncollected near the end of the course using SET.\n\nAssessment A: Article Critique\n\nStudents will complete two journal article critiques (10% for the first critique, 25% for the\nsecond critique). The review process both hones your ability to think critically about your\nown work and assists others in crafting quality manuscripts. Because this skill is an\nimportant one, we will spend time in class discussing how to write reviews. Reviews will be\nevaluated according to the following equally-weighted criteria:\n\u2022 How thorough is the reviewer in identifying conceptual problems in the paper?\n\u2022 How thorough is the reviewer in identifying technical problems in the paper?\n\u2022 How focused is the reviewer on key substantive issues (as opposed to only the minor\nbut obvious problems)?\n\u2022 How constructive is the reviewer in suggesting changes?\n\u2022 Overall, how useful is the feedback provided by the reviewer likely to be in revising\nthe paper?\n\nFor the first critique please use one of the three following articles:\n1. Bauer, T.N. & Green, S.G. 1996. Development of leader-member exchange: A\nlongitudinal test. Academy of Management Journal, 39: 1538-1567.\nBreevaart, K., Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., & Derks, D.

Organization Science,\n12: 582-598.\n\nAssessment B: Reflective Journal\n\nYou need to write up your reflections on the wealth of information you receive from the\nclass (write a maximum of one page each day, 10 days in all, excluding Day 1 and Day\n12). You may consider writing about ideas you find interesting, how these ideas affect\nyour understanding of leadership in general, how they affect your understanding of your\nown leadership styles, skills and effectiveness, whether these ideas help you to understand\nwhy you succeeded or failed to lead in a particular situation, or other related topics. At the\nend of the semester you need to integrate these reflections and develop a personal\nleadership development plan. You will need to submit your reflection for each day at the\nbeginning of the following class to receive the assigned points. The development plan may\nbe submitted one week after the final class. Late submissions will not be entertained.\nAlthough I will not grade your reflections, I will read them and provide you with feedback\nwhenever necessary.\n\nAssessment C: Class Participation\n\nYou need to be thoroughly prepared for each session by reading assigned articles and\ncases. Class discussions will include analysing assigned articles, synthesizing materials\nfrom multiple readings, applying ideas gleaned from articles to assigned cases and\nreflecting on experiences related to in-class exercises. Contributions to class discussions\nwill be judged as higher quality when they build on reading materials as well as comments\nmade by the instructor and your classmates.\n\nAssessment D: Leadership Project\n\nThis is a group project that includes a written project report (25%) and a presentation\n(15%). Groups will be formed in the first week of class. Group size will depend on total\nclass enrolment. The project requires you to analyse the leadership style(s), capabilities\nand effectiveness of a prominent leader. The written project should be approximately\n2,000 - 3,000 words (single spaced, 12 point font, 2.5 cm margin). It is due on the last day\nof class. Please inform me about the leader you wish to analyse prior to going ahead with\nthe project. The project should consist of three parts.\n1. A brief description of the leadership history of your chosen leader. Tell us what this\nperson did, key achievements, and key failures.\n2. An analysis of the leadership of this individual. In this section you should analyse\nthe basis of this individual\u2019s leadership: why did this person become a leader, what\naspects of their personal styles, capabilities and behaviours helped or hindered\nthem, what characteristics of their context helped or hindered them, and how\neffective they were. I want you to examine this individual\u2019s leadership using as a\nframework two (or at the most three) theories of leadership with which you are\nfamiliar.\n\n\f3. A discussion of how this person could have been more effective. In this section\ndiscuss briefly the conditions in which you think this person could have been a more\neffective leader. These conditions should be tied to the previous analysis. These\nconditions could include different followers, different social context, different levels\nof resources, different behaviours used by the leader, different motivations of the\nleader etc. The only condition that is not permissible as an option here is a\nrecommendation for the leader to get a personality change!\nYour sources of information for this project could include any form of public records. You\nshould include a list of references to your assignment.\nYou will present your analysis to the class. The presentation should last approximately 25\nminutes, followed by 10 minutes of questions from the class. The purpose of these\npresentations is to share with the class your research and analysis on the leaders, and\nalso to get class feedback on your project. You will be evaluated on the quality of your\nideas, their clarity and the extent to which your presentation engages the audience.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/ACCTG701.pdf", "text": "ACCTG 701 / FINANCE 701\n\nCourse Outline 2017\nACCTG 701 / FINANCE 701\nRESEARCH METHODS IN ACCOUNTING / FINANCE\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCOURSE PRESCRIPTION\nThis course examines the theory and application of modern research methods in accounting and finance. The\npurpose is to provide students with an understanding of how research is conducted in accounting and finance,\nsufficient such that they may critically evaluate the academic literature and have a foundation on which to build\ntowards carrying out their own research projects.\nGOALS OF THE COURSE\nThe course is divided into two parts. Part I covers research design issues and provides students with tools to\nevaluate the design and contribution of a research study. Part II provides students with the opportunity to evaluate\na broad cross section of accounting and finance research studies. These studies are chosen to demonstrate the\napplication of all commonly used research methods in accounting and finance, and the studies are concerned with\ntopical issues spanning major accounting and finance sub-disciplines, such as auditing, financial accounting,\nmanagement accounting, investments and corporate finance.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nStudents will get an understanding and appreciation of the research carried out in the discipline of accounting and\nfinance. They will also learn why various methods, in particular the scientific approach, are predominantly used\nin carrying out research in this discipline. Further, the knowledge learned in this course should be enough to allow\nstudents to carry out a basic research project.\nThe specific abilities that students will be able to demonstrate are as follows:\n1. evaluate accounting and finance related issues/research at an advanced level;\n2. explain accounting and finance related issues/research critically and intelligently;\n3. demonstrate verbal, written, and interpersonal communication skills, to a level where students can\ncommunicate knowledge clearly and succinctly;\n4. evaluate the benefits and role of research and advanced scholarship in the practice and the advancement of\nknowledge of accounting and finance, which will provide a desire and pathway to continue learning at higher\nlevels.\nLEARNING RESOURCES\nTexts and other useful references\nThe textbook for this course is \u201cResearch methods in business studies: A practical guide \u2013 Fourth edition\u201d, by\nPervez Ghauri and Kjell Gronhaug (Prentice-Hall, 2010). The text provides readings that supplement and add to\nthe material that is taught in this course, and which will provide a useful reference for your future studies at\npostgraduate level. Other readings will be handed out in advance of each class. The main library also has a\ncollection of research method textbooks that you might find as useful references.\nThe main library also has a subject librarian for accounting and finance.

Although\noverlapping, each sub-discipline has its own special research issues. For example, one might ask: What is the\neffect of financial accounting data on share prices?; What incentive compensation arrangement best motivates\nmanagers to act in the best interests of shareholders?; What factors affect the quality of auditors\u2019 judgements\nregarding the ability of a client to continue as a going concern?; What factors affect the relation between a firm\u2019s\ncapital structure and its cost of equity capital?; or What is the effect of a change in dividend policy on a firm\u2019s\nshare price? Identify questions, such as those above, that relate to the sub-discipline and that have been addressed\nin the accounting or finance literature. Journals that you are strongly recommended to search include: Accounting\nand Finance; Accounting, Organizations and Society; The Accounting Review; Journal of Accounting and\nEconomics; Journal of Accounting Research; Contemporary Accounting Research; Journal of Business Finance\nand Accounting; Management Accounting Research; Journal of Finance; Journal of Financial Economics;\nJournal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis; Pacific Accounting Review; and Review of Financial Studies.\nBegin your search with the most recent issues of each journal and work your way back until you find 10 articles\naddressing questions in your sub-discipline. Your taxonomy\u2019s reference list should record the 10 articles\nalphabetically by author consistent with the style of the APA, Journal of Accounting and Economics or Journal\nof Financial Economics. Skim your articles simply to identify research issues addressed and the methods used to\naddress them. Do not confuse yourself by trying to understand any theoretical modelling, statistical analysis or\nanything else in the article. Simply (but carefully) identify the research question and method/design as input to\nyour taxonomy.\nThere are two requirements in this project. First, for the 10 articles that you choose, you are required to: (i) describe\nthe research issue/question addressed in each study, and (ii) describe how each study was carried out by identifying\naspects of the research method/design used. Second, and more importantly, you are required to thoughtfully\norganize the research issues/questions and research method/design according to any patterns or relationships that\nyou may observe (for example, the valuation consequences of management incentive compensation arrangements\ncould be addressed using any of the following methods: theoretical modelling, field/case study, laboratory\nexperiment, questionnaire survey, or quasi-experimental use of archival empirical data) and to discuss the\norganizational structure you have identified. Choose whatever format you like, but be sure to clearly identify each\nresearch issue/question addressed, the article(s) addressing it, and the research method/design aspects used. Also\nshow, where possible, how the issues/questions addressed and/or the research method/design used in your 10\narticles relate to one another. At the outset, you should describe and justify the organizational structure you have\nchosen for your taxonomy.\n\n2\n\n\fACCTG 701 / FINANCE 701\nThe results will provide you with an idea of the many interesting issues and problems that need research in an\narea of accounting or finance that interests you.\nThe taxonomy must be typed and double-spaced, use a 12 point size font, margins (top, bottom, and sides) should\nbe at least 1 inch, and should be no more than 10 pages long (Note: This includes any appendices, tables, figures,\nand the reference list). It must also be submitted to Turnitin.\nAssignment: To be handed in to Course Co-ordinator by 0900 Monday 16 October\nYou should work individually to write an essay describing and critically evaluating one research article chosen\nfrom your taxonomy. Your essay should begin by carefully identifying and describing the research issue/question\nand hypotheses (if any) of the study. The essay should also include a discussion of the importance of the research\nissue/question. Why is it or is it not important to seek an answer to this issue/question? You should also identify\nthe research method and discuss its appropriateness. Does this method have the potential to expand our knowledge\nwith respect to the research issue/question? What are the strengths and weaknesses of this method in this context?\nThen your essay should critically evaluate the design of the study with particular attention to issues of internal,\nexternal, statistical, and construct validity. How effectively did the study deal with these issues? Finally, you\nshould describe the results of the study and carefully evaluate the appropriateness of any inferences the author(s)\ndraw from the results. At the end, you should also include a summary statement describing the degree to which\nthe study fulfilled its intended purpose and your view of the overall contribution of the study.\nThe essay must be typed and double-spaced, use a 12 point size font, margins (top, bottom, and sides) should be\nat least 1 inch, and should be no more than 10 pages long (Note: This includes any appendices, tables, figures,\nand the reference list). It must also be submitted to Turnitin.\nParticipation\nYou will earn marks for participation if you come to class having studied the reading material assigned for the\nday and if you participate in class discussion by offering appropriate/relevant comments and seeking clarification\nof important issues. The practical exercise also lies at the heart of this assessment.\nFinal Examination\nThe final examination will have a choice of essay questions covering all aspects of the course.\nCHEATING IN EXAMINATIONS AND COURSEWORK\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat, and views cheating in\ncoursework as a serious academic matter. The work that a student submits for grading must be the student's own\nwork, reflecting his or her learning. Where work from other sources is used, it must be properly acknowledged\nand referenced. This requirement also applies to sources on the internet. A student's assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request,\nstudents may be required to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the University of Auckland\u2019s Examination\nRegulations (see University Calendar, General Statutes and Regulations).\nWhat is cheating?\nTo cheat in the context of university assignments and examinations is to attempt to gain an unfair advantage by\nviolating the principles of intellectual and scholarly integrity. To cheat is to be intellectually dishonest by passing\noff as your own work that which has been done by someone else. To cheat is also unjust in that it devalues the\ngrades and qualifications gained legitimately by other students. All students and staff have a responsibility to\nprevent, discourage and report cheating.\nCheating may take various forms, some of which are:\n\uf0b7 Copying from another student during a test or examination. This is cheating whether or not there is collusion\nbetween the students involved. Collusion with another student who wishes to cheat from you exposes both\nparties to penalties under University Regulations.\n\uf0b7 Using the work of other scholars or students when preparing an assignment or writing an examination, and\npretending it is your own work by not acknowledging where it came from. This is called plagiarism and is\noutlined in a separate section below.\n\uf0b7 Copying from another student\u2019s on-course work whether that copying is with or without the knowledge of\nthat student. This includes:\n\uf0d8\nCopying all or part of someone else\u2019s assignment\n\uf0d8\nAllowing someone else to copy all or part of your assignment\n\n3\n\n\fACCTG 701 / FINANCE 701\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0d8\nHaving someone else do all or part of an assignment for you\n\uf0d8\nDoing all or part of someone else\u2019s assignment for them.\nImpersonating someone else in an examination, or arranging such impersonation.\nThe use of forbidden material in a test or examination, whether printed or in electronic form. For example,\nthe attempted use of a non-standard calculator in a restricted calculator examination.\n\nWhat is plagiarism?\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. A definition of plagiarism is: \u201cThe deliberate copying of another person\u2019s\nmaterial and the presentation of it as one\u2019s own\u201d. Plagiarism is the inclusion in your work of material closely\ncopied or paraphrased from someone else\u2019s writings (including work by other students or material off the internet)\nwithout explicit indication of the source of the material, that is, not referencing. Any material downloaded from\nthe internet must have the source properly acknowledged (such as a reference and URL in the bibliography).\nPlagiarism is not acceptable in any written work presented for assessment.\nHow to avoid plagiarism\nThe work and the ideas of other people must be acknowledged by correct referencing procedures. While students\nare encouraged to consult expert opinion, particularly in the form of books and journals and websites, to assist\nthem in better understanding and in the completion of their assignments, such opinion must be acknowledged by\nexplicit reference to the work consulted. In this course, students are encouraged to work collaboratively with\nanother and this is an important part of the University experience. However, within the particular permission\ngranted in this course to submit in pairs, it is also expected that the submitted work reflects the student\u2019s own\nunderstanding of the topic. If in any doubt about any of these issues, you should talk with a staff member to clarify\nyour concerns.\nPreventing cheating\nTypically students cheat because they are having difficulty with the course content, the language of the course or\nboth. Cheating and/or plagiarism can be a temptation when students are having difficulty with a heavy workload\nin the course and seek to save time by copying others work. The University provides many services to help\nstudents do better or to make thoughtful decisions about whether to continue. Within the Department, students\nshould first seek help from the lecturer. Outside the Department, the University offers help at the Student Learning\nCentre, and the English Language Acquisition Programme offers a range of courses to assist students whose first\nlanguage is not English. There is a difference between getting help and cheating. The former is directed towards\nassisting you to understand the material and the assignment questions so that you are in a better position to create\nyour own answers. Cheating involves supplying or being supplied with other people\u2019s answers.\nCLASS REPRESENTATIVE\nThe course is entitled to a class representative. The class representative will freely discuss any student concerns\nwith the lecturer. The representatives are also invited to staff/student consultative meetings if these are operative.\nThis is the appropriate forum for raising any unresolved concerns you have about the running of the paper. Student\nrepresentatives will be made known to the class as a whole.\nWe emphasise \u201cunresolved concerns\u201d since most problems can be resolved very simply by approaching the\nlecturer concerned (or any of the teaching staff). We are there to help.\nPROGRAMME AND COURSE ADVICE\nStudents passing this course will have the necessary knowledge to complete the more specialised discipline\nspecific courses in the Honours, PGDipCom, and Masters programmes at The University of Auckland. The course\nalso provides a foundation for students wishing to pursue further higher studies, such as in a doctoral programme.\n\n4\n\n\fACCTG 701 / FINANCE 701\nCONTENT OUTLINE\nThe session dates in the content outline below are approximate.

Students will be expected to critically analyse the issues faced by the\ncompany and propose appropriate solutions, taking into account environmental contexts\nand potential risks.\nMore specifically, the course seeks to inculcate students with a strategic outlook, through\nthe application of strategic theory and frameworks highlighting the interdependencies\namong factors at the macro (general environment affecting business), meso (industry\nenvironment), and micro (firm environment) levels. This involves crafting an effective\nstrategy that that cuts across organizational disciplines and allows the firm to prosper.\nThe overall aim of the course is to provide students a real world experience of strategy\ndevelopment.\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course, it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. Identify highly unstructured and uncertain problems and contextualize those problems\ninto critical strategy and competitive-related issues that a firm (real or case-based)\nmay be facing;\n2. Critically evaluate an issue or problem, incorporating both external and internal\nanalysis and supported through the use of appropriate data and other source\nmaterials;\n3. Formulate solutions and justify a strategic recommendation, demonstrating an\nintegration of skills and knowledge acquired throughout the programme;\n4. Generate and pitch a comprehensive, cohesive and viable business strategy designed\nto address the issues faced by a \u2018real world\u2019 company.\n\n\fContent Outline\nWeek 1\n\nIntroducing the case\n\nWeek 2\n\nBusiness models\n\nWeek 3\n\nIdentifying the problem\n\nWeek 4\n\nAnalysing context\n\nWeek 5\n\nAnalysing customers\n\nWeek 6\n\nAnalysing distribution\n\nWeek 7\n\nAnalysing resources and their location\n\nWeek 8\n\nStrategy development\n\nWeek 9\n\nEvaluating alternatives\n\nWeek 10\n\nImplementation\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThe class will typically meet for 5.5 hours each week. The 1.5-hour lecture will be devoted\nto techniques for conceptualising and analysing problems and opportunities that can be\napplied in the Capstone report. The 2-hour Tutorial will be devoted to workshops further\nexploring these techniques. The 2-hour Team-based Learning (TBL) session will be\ndevoted to team-based activities that apply the topics discussed in the lecture and the\ntools learned in workshops. Later in the course, some Tutorial and TBL time will be devoted\nto one-on-one meetings with teaching staff to address progress on the research project\nand individual presentations about project recommendations.\nIn addition to attending classes, students should be prepared to spend at least another\n10-12 hours a week on activities and research related to this course. General activities\ninclude completing the required readings prior to the lecture and keeping up with the\nbusiness press regarding current issues of relevance to this course. Most of this time will\nbe devoted to researching, analysing and writing the report for your capstone project.\nIndividual assessments are designed to enable you to develop and showcase critical and\nanalytical acumen, along with written and oral presentation skills. One group assessment\nis programmed to enhance skills in collaborative management, communication, and\nlearning in a team setting.\n\nTeaching Staff\nMr Denis Odlin, Professional Teaching Fellow, Graduate School of Management\n\n\fRm: 260-390\n\nExt. 89450\n\nEmail: d.odlin@auckland.ac.nz\n\nMr Bill Ross, Professional Teaching Fellow, Graduate School of Management\nRm: 260-362\n\nEmail: w.ross@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\nVan den Berg, G., & Pietersma, P.

Behavioural, strategic and social issues relating to the design, implementation\nand impact of information technology applications will be studied.\n\nGoals of the Course\nThis course focuses on Information Systems research and the nature of the discipline.\nWe start by looking at the nature of the field as shown by IS journals, conferences,\nresearchers and institutions. This is then followed by a critical examination and\nevaluation of contemporary IS research on a variety of topics. The idea is to give you a\nbroad understanding of the IS field as a whole.\nResearch in Information Systems (sometimes referred to as Management Information\nSystems) can be described as both inter-disciplinary and applied. It is inter-disciplinary in\nthat a number of reference disciplines (e.g. Management Science, Computer Science,\nOrganisation Theory, Psychology, Communications and Sociology) contribute some of the\nconcepts, techniques, and research questions addressed by the field. Information Systems\nis applied in the sense that the focus is on the application of the basic concepts to the\nproblem of analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation of computer-based information\nsystems in managerial and organisational settings. The constant introduction of new\ninformation technology and the continual discovery of new application areas ensures that\nIS research is dynamic, relevant and exciting.\nThe academic goal of most postgraduate students in the medium term is to complete a\nunique research project (e.g. Honours dissertation or Master\u2019s thesis). Therefore, the\npostgraduate programme in the Department of ISOM is designed to prepare students for\ndoing research. A basic grounding in the concepts underlying research in the discipline is\nessential if students are to succeed in completing the postgraduate programme.\nThis course is designed to introduce students to IS research. Students need to\nunderstand the nature of IS as a discipline and current research issues and themes. A\nnumber of current research areas will be identified and representative papers examined.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n\n1\n\n\f1)\n\nhave a good knowledge and understanding of a broad array of theories within\nthe field of information systems;gain competence in critical thinking, and\nanalysis and synthesis of academic sources;Learn how to structure a theoretical\nargument on an IS research topic.\n\nContent Outline (Subject to Change)\nWeek 1 Introduction\nA discussion of the course objectives, format, expectations and assessment procedures.\nAn introduction to theory.\nWeek 2 Behaviour Control Theory\nChua, C.

There will\nbe 10 quizzes worth 3 marks each.\nClass Presentation/ Comparative Essay\nThe core student deliverable in this class will be an analysis of how two competing\ntheories work within the context of an Information Systems problem.\nStudents will have to select two theories. The theories might either be those taught in\nclass, or other theories. The most likely outcome is the student will choose one theory\ntaught in class, and one other theory. The student must then apply the theory to an\ninformation systems problem/phenomenon of the student\u2019s choice.\nThe student\u2019s work should:\n(1) Compare and contrast the kind of insights the theories bring to the\nproblem/phenomenon. More importantly, the work should discuss the kinds of\ngaps the theories cannot solve.\n(2) Compare and contrast the predictions the theories make with regard to the\nproblem/phenomenon. Are the predictions right or wrong?\n(3) The culture of the theories and how that culture biases what the theories find.\nFor example, are most works in a particular theory positivist/quantitative?\n(4) The things the theory would suggest about the problem/phenomenon but that\nempirical work has yet not been done to test the theory.\n\n5\n\n\fHalfway through the semester, students will be asked to present their current line of\nthinking orally in front of the class.

Students can\nenrol in INFOSYS 750 or 751 concurrently with this course. INFOSYS 720 is a\nsubstantive overview of research in information systems, not a methods course. It is\ncompulsory for all students enrolled in or intending to enrol in the Masters of PhD\nprogramme.\nSince this course is taught at postgraduate-level, it is organised as a seminar, and not as\na series of lectures. This approach assumes that the lecturers and students can work\ntogether in a collaborative fashion. The role of the lecturers in this environment is to\nestablish a framework and put together a set of materials for discussion, and to create\nthe conditions suitable for learning. The underlying assumption is that we are all coproducers in learning.\nRunning the course as a seminar means that all students are expected to participate and\ncontribute equally to the discussion. It is assumed that students will have read and\nthought about the assigned materials before class and come prepared to contribute to\nthe class discussion. The classes are intended to be a forum for critically reviewing and\ndiscussing the set readings; students are expected to participate fully in this process.\nThe course will use a seminar format. Each paper will be assigned to a student who will\nlead the discussion. The student will be responsible for handing in a two-page summary\nand discussion questions at the start of class and will have overall responsibility for\nfacilitating the discussion of this article.\n\n6\n\n\fPlagiarism Statement\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat, and views\ncheating in coursework as a serious academic offence. The work that a student submits\nfor grading must be the student\u2019s work, reflecting his or her learning. Where work from\nother sources is used, it must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This requirement\nalso applies to sources on the world-wide web. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of their\nwork for computerised review.\n\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face- toface and/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nCourse Evaluation\nWhile I will assign a grade in this course (as required by the university), the final\nevaluation is yours. The real value of any course is what you learn which is best judged\nby you. I welcome and encourage any comments about the course, course materials\nand/or assignments at any time in order to make this learning experience as enjoyable\nand valuable as possible.\n\n7\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/INTBUS726.pdf", "text": "The University of Auckland Business School\nCourse Outline\nINTBUS 726 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (15 POINTS)\nQuarter 4, 2012\n\nCourse Prescription\nProvides in-depth analysis and comparison of foreign policies and their implications for\ninternational business.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon\nreasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of their work for\ncomputerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt about\nhow to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student Learning\nCentre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further information\nabout academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for the\nassignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee, where\nfurther penalties can be imposed.\n\n3\n\n\fTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends, parents,\nSLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that can\nbe given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give a copy\nof the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work, not\nan electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if required.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of referencing\nand how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students reference\ncorrectly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some major reference\nformats with examples.\n\n4\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSMGT703.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nBUSMGT 703: Professional Development Module 3 (7.5 POINTS)\n\nQuarter 2 (1174)\nCourse Prescription\nEngages the emerging manager in developing skills and capabilities that will enhance the\nability to work effectively and manage others including cross-border contexts.

The work that a\nstudent submits for grading must be the student\u2019s own work, reflecting his or her\nlearning. Where work from other sources is used, it must be properly acknowledged\nand referenced. This requirement also applies to sources on the world-wide web. A\nstudent\u2019s work may be reviewed against electronic source material using\ncomputerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be\nrequired to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review.\nStudents are encouraged to examine the following definitions of undesirable\nconduct:\n\nCollusion occurs when two or more individuals combine their efforts in order to\ndeceive the teaching staff as to who is responsible for a particular piece of work.\nCo-operation may be permitted in certain circumstances, where a joint study\neffort, class presentation or group project forms an appropriate part of the overall\nassessment.\n\n\fPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for\nmarking, plagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without\nexplicit acknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including\nbooks, journal articles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments.

These include readings and videos related to the course content, and working on\npractical assignments.\n\nPersonal Computers\n\nStudents must be prepared to bring their own computers to all classes. In Labs student will\nprimarily use their own computers. Windows 10 is preferred. Please upgrade if you have not\ndone so. If you have a Mac please install Windows 10 using software such as Parallels or\nBootcamp.\n\nLanguages\n\nThe emphasis of language learning in INFOMGMT192 is on reading, comprehension and\nmodifying code.\nThe course begins with the visual language Scratch as the introduction of the core elements\nof any procedural language. With these concepts established the students take an on-line\nself-learning course JavaScript, the language of the web. At the same time data analysis\nwith Excel is taught.\nIn the second half of the course the Unity 3D development tool is introduced. There are four\nprimary reasons for doing this.\n1. Because Unity3D has strong class and instance structure which manifest as \u201cphysical\u2019\nobjects it makes learning these concepts very clear to students.\n2. As the 3D interlace is a major growth area in the enterprise with the rapid the\nadoption of virtual, mixed and holographic displays.\n3. It is fun and very visually rewarding.\n4. With the basic syntax of JavaScript and C# being so close the students learn how\ntheir language skills are transferable.\n\nTeaching Staff\n\nDavid White\nOffice: 462, Owen G Glenn\nTel: 373 7599 x82894\nEmail: d.white@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\n\nThere is no prescribed textbook or course book for this course.

This is a self-directed paper, exploring a research\narea of your choice, as negotiated with a chosen supervisor. The outcome of this paper is\nan in-depth essay in which you will be required to analyse a topic using the extant\nliterature. There is an expectation that the student and the lecturer/supervisor will meet\nat regular intervals to discuss progress and for the lecturer to provide guidance. This is a\nself-directed project paper; students are responsible for ascertaining specific\nrequirements, maintaining contact with their supervisor, and pursuing appropriate\nresearch on empirical and theoretical literatures, under supervision. Many students have\nused this paper as a basis for further research and/or their career development. This\npaper should normally be taken as the LAST paper in a degree or major.\nThe course timeline is negotiated between student and their supervisor, but normally\nfollows a process of directed readings and development of a research paper on a\nparticular course against a timeline:\nWeeks 1\nWeeks 2-3\nWeeks 4-5\nWeek 6\n\nResearch Proposal/overview (300-500 words)\nLiterature Review\nFirst draft\nCompleted final draft (word length as specified\nplus references and exhibits)\nMarking\n\nExamination period\n\nSpecial Topic framework: 9000 word essay\nPoints\n10\n20\n\nWord length/limit\n6000\n12000\n\nPoints\n15\n30\n\nWord length/limit\n9000\n18000\n\nGrading Criteria:\nLetter and numerical grades will be used for feedback on assignments. Higher grades are\nusually obtained by:\n\uf0b7\n\ncritical and creative reflection on relevant literature. The emphasis is on identifying\nthe strengths and weaknesses of\nthe extant literature and then applying\ntheoretical ideas to the evaluation of practice and behaviour;\n\n\uf0b7\n\ncareful empirical research (eg reviewing and analysing primary and secondary\ndata). Unsupported assertions are not acceptable in academic work;\n\n\uf0b7\n\na well structured piece of work and logical flow to the argument;\n\n\f\uf0b7\n\ncareful revision of a first draft to edit material and refine word choice. Asking a\ncolleague or two to read and criticise it is usually valuable.\n\nThe following are the criteria that form the grading of performance in the assignments and\nexamination essays:\nA range (A+ = 90+): This shows excellence in the subject, fit to pass with high\ndistinction. It shows understanding of the relevant literature well beyond basic reading\nrequirements and/or shows perception of how theoretical debates or professional practice\ncould be significantly advanced. The argument is highly compelling. It is very hard to argue\nagainst the positions taken in the essay or assignment. The assessment or essay is highly\nreadable, enhancing the power of the ideas presented.\nB range (B+ = 75-79): This range shows strength in the subject, fit to pass with some\ndistinction. It shows the same faithful understanding of the key concepts and theories as\nthe C grade performance but reviews ideas with greater critical faculty or shows evidence of\nmore extensive knowledge. It also shows greater overall strength of argument than a C\ngrade and is likely to demonstrate a more proficient approach than lower grades. There are\nsome areas for improvement but the work shows the ability to perform beyond basic\ncompetence in the subject.\nC range (C+ 60-64): This range shows basic competence in the subject, fit to pass. It\nshows an advanced understanding of the relevant literature is revealed. The major\nacademic concepts and theories associated with the course are understood and\nappropriately applied to the business problem in question. However, performance would be\nimproved through greater investment in literature review or by a more active approach to\nlearning. Arguments are adequately defended with appropriate theory and empirical\nresearch, supporting the points of view espoused. However, deeper reflection on relevant\ntheory or more vigorous engagement with the ideas of others would lead to improvements\nin certain aspects of the argument. Word choice is appropriate but writing style may be\nsomewhat pedestrian.\nD range (D+ 45-49): This range fails to show basic competence in the subject and is not\nfit to pass. Here major concepts and theories relevant to the work and course are\noverlooked, misunderstood or misapplied to practice. The argument is logically flawed\nand/or empirical sources have been misunderstood or completely omitted. Word choice is\noften inappropriate, compromising the effectiveness of communication.\n\n2\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/ACCTG771.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nACCTG 771 ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AND CAPITAL MARKETS\nSemester 2 (1175)\n\nCourse Prescription\nThis paper examines the relation between financial accounting information and capital markets.

The course is\nmost useful if taken simultaneously or after the supply chain strategy (OPSMGT 370) and\nbusiness analytics (INFOMGT 290) courses but before the supply chain coordination course\n(OPSMGT 376 \u201cStrategic procurement\u201d).\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. understand interconnectedness of the decision areas in a supply chain;\n2. understand the necessity of using and steps of developing models for business\ndecision-making;\n3. create a variety of spreadsheet models most commonly used for making best\ndecisions in logistics and supply chain management; and\n4. demonstrate creative thinking and analytical capabilities to solve typical supply\nchain problems.\n\nContent Outline\n\nThe following topics will be covered (the sequence and timing as per the \u201cCourse schedule\u201d\non Canvas):\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\nIntroduction to business logistics\nOptimisation modelling\nTransportation planning\nNetwork design\nDemand forecasting\nInventory management\nAggregate planning\n\n\fLearning and Teaching\n\n1. The pedagogy of the course revolves around improving students\u2019 abilities to handle\nreal-life problems, to create solutions as opposed to memorising the lessons taught\nin class or presented in the textbook: \u201c\u2026 trying to learn from watching a professor\nlecturing [It's] like trying to lose weight by watching a professor exercising\u201d (Dr.\nSebastian Thrun). Most of the class time is devoted to students\u2019 \u201chands-on\u201d\nlearning, specifically to developing models in MS Excel.\n2. Students interested in more practice (and bonus marks) have an option and are\nencouraged to do a group assignment, which will provide more opportunity for indepth thinking and for applying lessons/techniques learned in class.\n3. It is expected that a student studying according to the lecturer\u2019s recommendations,\nin particular, investing about five hours every week into studying for the course\noutside of the class, will get the letter grade of \u201cB\u201d or above.\n\nTeaching Staff\n\nMr Mojtaba Mahdavi\nEmail: m.mahdavi@auckland.ac.nz\nOffice hours: TBA via Canvas.\n\nLearning Resources\n\nThe recommended textbook for this course is: Chopra S., and Meindl P.

In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\nCHEATING AND PLAGIARISM\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may\n\n\fbe reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\nmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an\nelectronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for\nfurther information about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to\navoid plagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/PROPERTY370.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nPROPERTY 370: BUILDING SURVEYING (15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCourse Prescription\n\nBuilds the specific knowledge and skills required to work within the building surveying\nprofession.

A workshop on coding qualitative data will be included.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nRestriction: MKTG 703, 704\nNote: In order to practice the skills of qualitative research, this course has a formal requirement that students act as participants in research related activities; e.g., to practice\ninterviewing, students will need to be interviewees.This coursework research is explicitly\npedagogical, it contributes directly to the course content and objectives, and the information collected is not for wider dissemination. Nevertheless, it is important that students\nknow that there are no assurances that their participation in these activities will be treated\nconfidentially.\nYour continued enrolment in this course will be taken as your consent to act as a participant\nin this course\u2019s research related activities.\nIt\u2019s hard to practice interviewing if no-one wants to be interviewed.\n\nGoals of the Course\nMy overarching goal for this course is to prepare you to undertake your first (and perhaps\nonly) research project of any size; e.g., a masters (60-point) dissertation or an honours\n(30-point) dissertation. This is my touchstone in all my thinking regarding BUSINESS\n705. To that end, I want you to be able to select qualitative research methods that are\nappropriate for your chosen academic conversation (Huff, 2009), and to use those methods\nin a proficient manner.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. select qualitative research methods that are appropriate to the research conversation\nin which the student wishes to participate;\n2. be proficient in use tools and techniques to collect qualitative data;\n3. be proficient in use tools and techniques to analyse qualitative data;\n1\n\n\f4. effectively communicate the findings arising from the collection and analysis of qualitative data;\n5. describe how the choices they make around the collection, analysis, and presentation\nof qualitative data is congruent with their chosen research conversation;\n6. evaluate the quality of qualitatively-based research methods;\n7. employ the tools and techniques of qualitative research methods in a manner that is\nethical.\n\nContent Outline\nThis course gives a broad overview of the essential aspects of qualitative research methods.\nIn this six-week course this achieved by addressing the following topics:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nYou and qualitative research\nQualitative research methods\nCollecting qualitative data\nAnalysing qualitative data\nPresenting your results\n\nLearning and Teaching\nPractice makes perfect, or so they say. Consequently, much of our time together in class\nwill be spent practising the tools and techniques of qualitative research. For this to be\neffective you will need to complete the required pre-work before each class; this includes\nreadings and writing tasks.\nIf you require help tackling the pre-work, then you should contact the teaching staff.\n\nTeaching Staff\nPeter Smith\nOffice: Room 439, OGG Building\nTel: 09 923 7178\nEmail: p.smith@auckland.ac.nz\nOffice hours: Wednesdays from 15:00\u201316:00, or by appointment\n\nTime management\nIt is expected that the average student will need to spend approximately 20 hours per week\non work relating to this course. Of that time, about six hours take the form of classwork.\nThe remaining fourteen hours should be split between: (a) completing the week\u2019s readings,\n(b) preparing for the class exercised, (c) completing assessments.\n\nLearning Resources\nThe textbooks upon which this course is based are:\nHuff, A.

Failure to comply with the terms of this warning may expose you to legal action\nfor copyright infringement and/or disciplinary action by the University.\n\nCheating and plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking, plagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit acknowledgment.\nWork can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal articles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be reviewed against\nelectronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable\nrequest, students may be required to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone; your lecturers, tutors and the Student\n3\n\n\fLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. For the first instance of cheating, if it occurs in this department, your\nassignment will not be marked, which effectively gives you zero for the assignment. There\nwill be no opportunity to do a \u2018make up\u2019 assignment. Major offences can be sent to the\nUniversity\u2019s Discipline Committee, where further penalties can be imposed.\n\nReferences\nHuff, A. S. (2009). Designing research for publication.

It considers the different tax regimes\napplicable to trusts, partnerships and limited partnerships, Passive Investment Entities (PIEs),\ncharities and M\u0101ori authorities. Comparision between these entities is intended to provide a\ndeeper understanding of the policy behind New Zealand\u2019s tax regimes and the allocation of\nthe tax burden between companies and other entities.\nGoals of the Course\nThe paper is an advanced course studying New Zealand\u2019s tax law relating to different noncorporate entities. The objectives of the course are to provide students with both a theoretical\nbackground and high level of technical knowledge of the scope and application of the most\nsignificant aspects of the law and practice. This includes an understanding of the legal\nstructure of these entities, the different tax treatment, and the policy and objectives behind this\ntax treatment.\nThe course provides students with an opportunity to increase their research, writing and group\npresentation skills. The final exam (which is by way of answering a case study) requires\nstudents to apply all aspects of taxation law and policy which they have mastered during the\ncourse. Emphasis is therefore placed on good analytical skills and presentation of researched,\ncomprehensive and well reasoned solutions. In addition the course gives the student the\nopportunity to participate in a group discussion which is conducted in a supportive and\nentertaining environment.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents who take and pass this course will be able to:\n1. Identify and comprehend the major aspects of the operation of the Income Tax Act\n2007 in so far as they relate to the taxation of non-corporate business structures\n2. Analyse the policies and principles underlying this regime\n3. Analyse and evaluate the application of the New Zealand income tax rules in so far as\nthey relate to taxation consequences which arise for business transactions in different\nentity structures\n4.

Davis\nLaw Library staff are available to assist students in accessing all on-line materials available.\nA course book will be distributed to students prior to the course. Please endeavour to have\nread as much as you can.\n\n\fAssessment\nThe final grade for the course is made up by the following:\nAttendance and Participation in seminars\nFinal Take-home Exam\n\n20%\n80%\n\nDue to the technical nature of the Income Tax Act 2007, the course assessments test research\nand analytical skills. Each piece of written work requires students to demonstrate knowledge\nof a number of different regimes of the Act, thereby testing their depth of knowledge and\nunderstanding of the underlying policy.\nPlusage does not apply.\nRefer to the Postgraduate Guide 2014 for further information.\n\nFinal take-home exam\nYour course lecturer will indicate the maximum word limit for the answer to that case study,\nwhich is to be strictly observed.\nPapers are expected to be well researched and considered works, which set out clearly their\nintended scope and deal with the subject in a well-structured fashion. Perspectives on a topic\nmay be gained from a historical or comparative analysis, or from insights provided by other\ndisciplines, eg accounting or economics. Their presentation should be of a high standard,\nsimilar to that required for submission to an academic journal. Case, text and journal citations\nshould be in the format prescribed by the New Zealand Law Style Guide. Grades will be\nawarded in accordance with the Department\u2019s policy \u201cThe Basis for Assessment of Legal\nWriting\u201d.\nAttendance and Participation\nAttendance and participation are worth 20% of the final grade. Allocating marks to class\nparticipation reflects the desire to encourage feedback and discussion within the course. As\nall seminar papers are circulated one week before presentation, all students need to have read\nand considered these papers prior to the class, and be prepared to discuss them. The small\nsize of the classes encourages interaction and student participation.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: Selected Applicants with BCom, BCom(hons), LLB, LLB(hons) or similar.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSMKT706.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nBUSMKT 706: Cases in Strategy (15 POINTS)\nQuarter 3 (1176)\n\nCourse prescription\n\nFocuses on the practical development, implementation and control of strategies needed to\nattain and sustain an organisation\u2019s competitive advantage.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: BUSMGT 751-753, 743 with at least a B average.\n\nGoals of the course\n\nCentral to the core skill set of international business and marketing managers is the need\nto monitor and analyse the critical current issues in the global marketplace which will\nimpact on their organisations\u2019 strategies and competitive advantage.

The course involves critical thinking and developing persuasive\narguments which rely on knowledge of the international business/marketing environment,\nidentifying business-relevant examples and interpreting relationships between the factors\nand themes, and the significance of their effects. The course will equip you to formulate\ndifferent perspectives and be able to position yourself more effectively in your international\nbusiness or marketing career.\n\n3\n\n\fThis course has 100% in-course assessment with as much tailoring to individual interests\nas possible. This is made up of a mix of individual written assignments which build on each\nother to form one report, personal reflections, and an in-class presentation.\nThis mix of activities enables you to produce a cumulative written submission that builds\nup and offers practice and the opportunity to receive feedback on your report writing which\nwill be useful for the consultancy output. The assignments build up, and the final\npresentation can thus reinforce and give feedback on the essential oral communication\nskills you will also need for your consultancy project presentation and your future career.\n\nAssessment summary\nWeek\n1\n(10%)\n2\n(15%)\n3\n(75%)\nTotal\n\nWritten\nsubmissions\n5\n\nPersonal\nreflections\n5\n\nPresentations\n\n10\n\n5\n\n-\n\n40\n\n10\n\n25\n\n55%\n\n20%\n\n25%\n\n-\n\n1.

This is for you to show your engagement\nwith the material and to stimulate active learning and participation by others. The key\nquestions you will need to ask yourself include:\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\nWhat do you think is important?\nWhat new information or knowledge did you gain?\nHow can you use this?\nWhat would you like to share with the rest of us?\n\nAll students will be called upon and this will form part of the grade. There is no group\nassessment in this course and, although the course is graded individually, discussion and\nanalysis in study groups is encouraged. In the reflections and discussions students gain\ncredit for insights, integration of ideas, and clear communication. Those who miss classes\nwill obviously miss the opportunity to earn these grades. I expect you to get more\nconfident with this, so it is worth more marks in Week 3. There are 6 reflections sessions,\n2 each week, and I will take your best grade for each week as your final grade for this\ncomponent.\nTo demonstrate active learning and participation involves:\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\uf0d8\n\nBeing fully prepared;\nShowing enthusiasm and engagement with the material;\nOffering insightful comments and questions;\nBuilding on others\u2019 contributions;\nGiving constructive criticism of others\u2019 contributions;\nSharing in the shaping of the discussion;\nIntegrating what others have said;\nCommunicating effectively and concisely.\n\n4\n\n\fEach student will make two weekly contributions to class discussion by giving their\nreflection on the application of the material covered in each topic. This is graded as: A\nrange = 4-5%, B range = 2.4-3%, C range = 1-2%. The overall quality and insight of\ncomments and contribution to class discussion will be assessed by the lecturer, but general\nguidelines for assessing the quality of the comments made in class are as follows:\nExcellent participation (As) = Always very well-prepared for class, always able to comment\non the reading and their own readings, analysis and reflection on the material. Outstanding\ninsights will warrant an excellent grade. Consistently contributes meaningfully and\nenthusiastically to class discussions, and shows active listening by responding\nconstructively to the lecturer and other members of the group.\nVery good participation (Bs) = Well-prepared for class, able to comment to some extent\non the readings and their analysis of them, demonstrated by a high level of meaningful\nparticipation in class discussion. Demonstrates active listening by providing quality\nresponses to the lecturer and other students\nAcceptable participation (Cs) = Generally prepared for class, contributing comments in\nclass. Responds to the class discussion with less insight than for \u2018very good\u2019 and \u2018excellent\u2019\nparticipation, but demonstrating a clear understanding of the topic.\nInadequate participation (0) = The preparation for class is not demonstrated in\ncontributions to class discussions. Contributes infrequently, or fails to demonstrate insight\ninto the topic under discussion. May have to be called upon to contribute.\nFor further details about the marking of this participation, see the rubric at the end of this\ndocument.\nGrades will be made available weekly and students may see the lecturer to elicit feedback\non their participation performance or on any other aspect of the course.\n2. Written assignments (55%)\nThere are five parts, which build into one report. For each week\u2019s topics you are to use the\nreadings and find at least two other sources of information about the topic \u2013 which adds\nup to 3 sources per topic including the set reading, so you will have at least 15 references\nin the final report.\nUsing your consultancy company as a focus, you will find out more about what each of the\ncurrent issues and themes in international business and marketing means for that context\nand how each topic applies now or could have an impact on it in the future. The aim is to\nanalyse the issues or themes, assess their importance and present a solution to address\ntheir strategic impact. NB: You may not use any of the written work you submit for\nthis course in your consultancy report. A draft of each part should be reviewed by the\nBusiness Communication team through their draft Turnitin submission point prior to final\nsubmission to me in Canvas and in hard copy either in class or in the BUSINT/BUSMKT\n706 mailbox on Level 3.\nWeek 1\nPart 1 (5%): Write an introductory paragraph that explains to me what (consultancy)\ncontext you will focus on. This gives your initial thoughts and will be re-drafted and edited\nbefore it is incorporated into the final submission. 5-600 words due in hard copy to me by\n5pm on Friday 23rd June.\nWeek 2\n\n5\n\n\fPart 2 (10%): Analyse the 2 macro/global topics (Topics 1 and 2). How important are\nthey for your consultancy project and how could they impact on it? Write 1000-1200\nwords, 1.5 line spacing, with a list of references (not included in the word count). Please\nensure you get feedback from the Business Communication team on a draft of this before\nsubmission to Canvas and hard copy to me by 9am Wednesday 28th June.\nPart 3 (10%): Analyse the 2 macro/organisational topics (Topics 3 and 4). How important\nare they for your consultancy project and how could they impact on it? Write 1000-1200\nwords, 1.5 line spacing, with a list of references. Please ensure you get feedback from the\nBusiness Communication team on a draft of this before submission to Canvas and in hard\ncopy to me by 9am on Monday 3rd July.\n\nWeek 3\nPart 4 (10%): Analyse the micro-level (Topics 5 and 6). How important are they for you\nand your consultancy project and how could it impact on these? Write 1000-1200 words,\n1.5 line spacing, with a list of references (not included in the word count). Please ensure\nyou get feedback from the Business Communication team on a draft of this before\nsubmission to Canvas and in hard copy to me by 5pm on Friday 7th July.\nPart 5 (20%): Integrate the four written parts into one full report and make any changes\nthat arise from the feedback from the previous assignments. The report should have a\nminimum of 3,500 words and a maximum of 4,000, 1.5 line spacing, with a list of\nreferences (not included in the word count). Due to me any time before 9am on\nWednesday 12th July.\n3.

There have also been personnel changes involving the staff responsible\nfor teaching the course.\nFeedback on the content of the course and its delivery are sought during the course by the\nteaching staff through the medium of fast feedback during the course. In addition, formal course\nevaluations are carried out at the end of the course. As a result of feedback, some changes have\nbeen implemented this quarter. These include more contents on how contracts are administered\nand managed and how to comply with the law regarding misleading conduct.\nYour feedback, both during the course and at its completion, is sought and encouraged. You can\ncontact your class representatives to pass on your feedback to ensure your anonymity or you can\ncontact the teaching or program staff direct.\nClass representatives will be chosen in the first week of the course and their details posted on\nCanvas.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat, and views\ncheating in coursework as a serious academic offence. The work that a student submits for grading\nmust be the student's own work, reflecting his or her learning. Where work from other sources is\nused, it must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This requirement also applies to sources\non the world-wide web. A student's assessed work may be reviewed against electronic source\nmaterial using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be\nrequired to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review.\n\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your courses\nthroughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions, the University has contingency plans to\nensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is fair, and not compromised.\nSome adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In the event of a disruption, the\nUniversity and your course coordinators will make every effort to provide you with up-to-date\ninformation via Canvas and the university website.\n\n11\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSINESS390.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2016\nBUSINESS 390: BBIM CAPSTONE PROJECT (15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1165)\nCourse Prescription\n\nApplied business project that requires the integration of skills and theory in business and\ninformation management.

The design for this course stresses cross-disciplinary collaboration with\nBBIM students from the accounting and marketing majors forming mixed teams. While\nthe majority of BUSINESS 390 will be individually assessed, a strong team-based process\nruns throughout the course. The various individual assessments are all closely linked to a\ncentral assessment in the form of your team\u2019s formal written business plan. A midsemester test is designed to encourage the planning and critical thinking necessary for\nthe development of this business plan.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. Explain the function and key components of a business plan\n2. Identify and organise the major tasks and their sequence required to prepare and\npresent a business plan\n3. Contribute to most components within a business plan\n4. Prepare a set of financial analyses and reports appropriate for a generic business\nplan\n5. Demonstrate critical and creative thinking in formulating and justifying\nappropriate business strategies, recommendations and/or solutions\n6. Review and critique a venture summary from a management perspective,\ndemonstrating critical thinking in your assessment and evaluation (from a\npotential investor\u2019s perspective) of the proposed strategies, recommendations\nand/or solutions of others, and\n7. Work effectively as a member of a professional team in developing and delivering\nprofessional written and oral outcomes.\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nThe first part of this course is part lecture-based and part workshop-based. The lecturebased materials lead to a mid-semester test. This mid-semester test is intended to\ndevelop the individual skills and thinking processes you will need to work with your teammates in the development of your business plan. The workshop-based materials will also\nhelp you to prepare as an individual for your mid-semester test but, more importantly,\nthese early workshop-based activities are about getting your team effectively started\n\n\fwith your project. During the second part of the course your team will then prepare,\nsubmit, and present your completed team business plans. There will be no formal\nlectures during this second part of the course. Instead, the regular weekly class time will\nbe used for interactive mentoring processes and/or progress meetings.\n\nTeaching Staff\nDr. Douglas Carrie\nDepartment of Marketing\nEmail: d.carrie@auckland.ac.nz\n\nDr. Davood Askarany\nDepartment of Accounting\nEmail: d.askarany@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\nGiven the applied nature of this course, and the fact that this is a project that aims to\ndraw on your learning from other courses, there is no traditional textbook. Instead, you\ncan find links to all of your required readings via a Talis cousre reading list within\nCanvas. These online learning resources will be introduced and explained during our first\nlecture.\n\nAssessment\nAssessment\n\nWeighting\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nMid-Semester Test\nPeer Review of another team\u2019s formative venture\nsummary\nProgress Report\nBusiness Plan (Written report plus oral\npresentation, a groupwork mark)\n\n30%\n20%\n\n1\n6\n\n10%\n40%\n\n1, 2, 3, 5\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\nTotal\n\n100%\n\nGiven its nature as a Capstone Project experience, there is a 40% groupwork component\nto this course. However, there is also a confidential peer evaluation system which aims to\nensure that all individuals have contributed effectively to the team process. While it is\nrelatively rare to see penalties applied, it is important to note that those students who do\nnot successfully contribute to the team process (i.e. \u201cfree riders\u201d) should not expect to\nautomatically receive marks that were earned by the rest of the team.\nIn addition to the above, there are four requirements that you will need to complete as\npart of your business plan journey:\n(1) Team contract (team task)\n(2) Team project proposal (team task)\n(3) Team formative venture summary (team task)\n(4) Confidential end-of-course team peer evaluations (individual task)\nNone of these additional deliverables will counts for marks. However, these four tasks are\nconsidered to be essential elements that will lead to the completion of a successful\nproject. Therefore, this course will be considered as \u201cincomplete\u201d until all four of these\nadditional requirements have been met. This means that no team will receive any marks\nfor the Business Plan component of the course unless the team has also successfully\ncompleted all three of these additional team requirements, e.g. the team contract,\nproject proposal, and formative venture summary. This also means that no individual\nstudent will receive any marks for the Business Plan component of the course unless he\nor she has successfully completed the team peer evaluation process. The only exceptions\nto this will be when a team or individual has applied for special consideration due to\nillness or other unfortunate circumstances.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/ECON151G.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nECON 151G: UNDERSTANDING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY\n(15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\n\nCourse Prescription\nEconomics affects our daily lives and the global environment in many ways.

This qualitative data, which is administered, collected and collated by the\nProgramme Office, is designed as an \u2018early warning\u2019 system of any significant issues with\nthe course that might need addressing quickly.\nLecturers are asked to provide a brief report to the Director GSM MBA on key items\nidentified and proposed actions. Lecturers are also asked to provide a verbal report to\nthe class, proposing any solutions as appropriate.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nThe University of Auckland evaluates the quality of teaching and of courses by using the\nthe Summative Evaluation Tool, or SET. Summative evaluation is formal, summative\nevaluation of teaching undertaken according to University policy and is conducted at the\nend of a semester/quarter through the use of the formal University SET instruments.\nSummative evaluation is used by teachers to reflect on their teaching practice, and is\nalso used by the University for quality assurance of teaching and courses.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may\nbe reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\nmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an\nelectronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for\nfurther information about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\n\nge\n\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to\navoid plagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\n\nSu\n\nbj\n\nec\n\ntt\n\no\n\nch\n\nan\n\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/ECON773.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nECON 773: THE HISTORY OF ECONOMIC THOUGHT (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\nCourse Prescription\nThis covers a selection of topics in the history of economic ideas, including classical\neconomics, post-classical microeconomics; topics in twentieth century economics including\nKeynesian economics, monetarism, institutional economics, evolutionary economics,\nAustrian economics and twentieth century ideas on monetary economics, and international\nmonetary reform.\n\nProgression and Course Advice\nThe level and content of this course require that students have a good grasp of macro- and\nmicroeconomics.

Lecture slides and associated material serve as a guide only and do not\nsubstitute for the oral presentation. The course is not suitable for students who\ncannot attend and participate in class discussion on a regular basis and there will\nbe no recordings of class lectures.\nGoals of the Course\nTo provide students with a good understanding of the role of banks and other\nfinancial institutions in the financial system, the rationale for their regulation, the\nways in which they are regulated and their contribution to the global financial\ncrisis, so this can be used for advanced study or participation in financial markets.\nLearning Outcomes\nAt the end of the course students will be able to:\n1. Describe and understand the function of the banking system and the other\nmain financial institutions in New Zealand and round the world\n2. Understand the structure and degree of independence of central banks and\nconduct of monetary policy\n3. Demonstrate knowledge of the theory and practice of regulation of the\nfinancial system and banking in particular\n4. Show an understanding of the role of banks in causing the global financial\ncrisis and how central banks responded to the crisis\n5. Understand how to benefit from the role of banks as intermediaries in the\neconomy and to understand the risks that are involved in banking as\nbankers, depositors and borrowers\n\n\fCourse Schedule\nList of topics (Sessions 1-12) Note: while this list shows the ordering of the\ntopics they do not necessarily correspond to exact weeks\n1.

All course\nmaterial is examinable. These four forms of assessment will assess your ability to\ndemonstrate an understanding of the learning objectives.\n\n3\n\n\fInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements faceto-face and/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\nCHEATING IN EXAMINATIONS AND COURSEWORK\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat,\nand views cheating in coursework as a serious academic matter. The work that a\nstudent submits for grading must be the student's own work, reflecting his or her\nlearning. Where work from other sources is used, it must be properly\nacknowledged and referenced. This requirement also applies to sources on the\nworld-wide web. A student's assessed work may be reviewed against electronic\nsource material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable\nrequest, students may be required to provide an electronic version of their work\nfor computerised review.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the University of\nAuckland\u2019s Examination Regulations (see University Calendar, General Statutes\nand Regulations).\nWhat is cheating?\nTo cheat in the context of university assignments and examinations is to attempt\nto gain an unfair advantage by violating the principles of intellectual and scholarly\nintegrity. To cheat is to be intellectually dishonest by passing off as your own work\nthat which has been done by someone else. To cheat is also unjust in that it\ndevalues the grades and qualifications gained legitimately by other students. All\nstudents and staff have a responsibility to prevent, discourage and report cheating.\nCheating may take various forms, some of which are:\n\uf0b7 Copying from another student during a test or examination. This is cheating\nwhether or not there is collusion between the students involved. Collusion with\nanother student who wishes to cheat from you exposes both parties to penalties\nunder University Regulations.\n\uf0b7 Using the work of other scholars or students when preparing an assignment or\nwriting an examination, and pretending it is your own work by not\nacknowledging where it came from. This is called plagiarism and is outlined in\na separate section below.\n\uf0b7 Copying from another student\u2019s on-course work whether that copying is with\nor without the knowledge of that student. This includes:\n\uf0d8\nCopying all or part of someone else\u2019s assignment\n\uf0d8\nAllowing someone else to copy all or part of your assignment\n\uf0d8\nHaving someone else do all or part of an assignment for you\n\uf0d8\nDoing all or part of someone else\u2019s assignment for them.\n\uf0b7 Impersonating someone else in an examination, or arranging such\nimpersonation.\n\uf0b7 The use of forbidden material in a test or examination, whether printed or in\nelectronic form. For example, the attempted use of a non-standard calculator\nin a restricted calculator examination.\n\n4\n\n\fWhat is plagiarism?\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. A definition of plagiarism is: \u201cThe deliberate\ncopying of another person\u2019s material and the presentation of it as one\u2019s own\u201d.\nPlagiarism is the inclusion in your work of material closely copied or paraphrased\nfrom someone else\u2019s writings (including work by other students or material off the\ninternet) without explicit indication of the source of the material, that is, not\nreferencing. Any material downloaded from the internet must have the source\nproperly acknowledged (such as a reference and URL in the bibliography).\nPlagiarism is not acceptable in any written work presented for assessment.\nHow to avoid plagiarism\nThe work and the ideas of other people must be acknowledged by correct\nreferencing procedures. While students are encouraged to consult expert opinion,\nparticularly in the form of books and journals and websites, to assist them in better\nunderstanding and in the completion of their assignments, such opinion must be\nacknowledged by explicit reference to the work consulted. In this course, students\nare encouraged to work collaboratively with another and this is an important part\nof the University experience. However, within the particular permission granted in\nthis course to submit in pairs, it is also expected that the submitted work reflects\nthe student\u2019s own understanding of the topic. If in any doubt about any of these\nissues, you should talk with a staff member to clarify your concerns.\nPreventing cheating\nTypically students cheat because they are having difficulty with the course content,\nthe language of the course or both. Cheating and/or plagiarism can be a temptation\nwhen students are having difficulty with a heavy workload in the course and seek\nto save time by copying others work. The University provides many services to\nhelp students do better or to make thoughtful decisions about whether to continue.\nWithin the Department, students should first seek help from the lecturer. Outside\nthe Department, the University offers help at the Student Learning Centre, and\nthe English Language Acquisition Programme offers a range of courses to assist\nstudents whose first language is not English. There is a difference between getting\nhelp and cheating. The former is directed towards assisting you to understand the\nmaterial and the assignment questions so that you are in a better position to create\nyour own answers. Cheating involves supplying or being supplied with other\npeople\u2019s answers.\nCLASS REPRESENTATIVE\nThe course is entitled to a class representative. The class representative will freely\ndiscuss any student concerns with the lecturer. The representatives are also invited\nto staff/student consultative meetings if these are operative.\nThis is the\nappropriate forum for raising any unresolved concerns you have about the running\nof the paper. Student representatives will be made known to the class as a whole.\nWe emphasise \u201cunresolved concerns\u201d since most problems can be resolved very\nsimply by approaching the lecturer concerned (or any of the teaching staff). We\nare there to help.\n\n5\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSMGT714.pdf", "text": "BUSMGT 714: Economics for Managers (15 points)\nQuarter 2, 2017 (1174)\n\nCourse Prescription\nExamines attributes and behaviours of consumers, firms, markets and institutions and\ntheir impacts on the macro-economy.

In\naddition, each course will seek volunteers to serve as class reps.\nPlagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without\nexplicit acknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books,\njournal articles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work\nmay be reviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection\nmechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic\nversion of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\n\n\fThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties, you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available\nat: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite websitewww.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\nAssignment Submission\nAll assignments for this course should be submitted through the Assignments section of\nthese course webpages, after going through the standard review process. This process is\nas follows:\n1. assignment draft is run through Grammarly\n2. Grammarly report and assignment draft are submitted to the assignment draft point\nfor language, grammar and structure review and feedback by the Business\nCommunication team, and for originality checking. This draft point will close no later\nthan 24 hours before the assignment submission deadline\n3. final assignment, which incorporates the Business Communication team feedback on\nlanguage and originality, is submitted to the final submission point\nThe draft and final submission points can be found in the Assignments section of\nthese webpages.\n\nCheating and Late Submissions and Special Consideration\nFor any queries about the programme policies around the late submission of assignments,\nor for special consideration or aegrotat processes, please contact the Programme Manager.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/FINANCE751.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nFINANCE 751: Modern Corporate Finance\nSemester 2 (1175)\n\nGoal of the Course\nThis course covers contemporaneous issues in corporate finance and builds on knowledge\nacquired in Finance 351. The course is designed to immerse post-graduate students in key\ncorporate finance research and research methodologies, thereby providing them with a\nframework for considering other corporate finance problems and issues. The material studied\nduring the course is a blend of key theoretical and empirical corporate finance work, with\nparticular emphasis on the interface between theoretical models and empirical tests of these\nmodels.\nThis course is based on seminars in which students present papers. There will be two or three\npapers assigned in each week. Each paper will be presented by a student or a team, and a group\ndiscussion will follow in which all are expected to participate.\n\nLearning Resources\nAll readings and other learning resources can be obtained through Cecil, scholar.google.com,\nssrn.com or electronic databases at UABS.\n\nPresentations\nEach group of students (a group of two or three) will be responsible for two team seminar\npresentations. Seminar presenters are required to prepare presentations and lead the discussion.\nPresenters are expected to go beyond the paper as opposed to giving a mere summary of the\npaper. In particular, presenters should address questions such as: What is the importance of the\npaper? How does it relate to the literature in the area? (A brief overview of related papers is\nnecessary to address this question.) What are the practical implications of the paper? Are there\nany unanswered questions? Can the research design be improved? Are there any ambiguities?\nPresenters are welcome and encouraged to see the instructor before their presentations and\ndiscuss their assigned papers well ahead of time. The seminar presentations account for 20% of\nyour final grade.\n\nParticipation and Assignment\nThis course relies heavily on students' participation in seminars. Learning in a seminar is an\nevolving process which includes outside preparation and seminar discussions. Participation\ngrade will be determined by a combination of evident preparation, participation, and quality of\nparticipation. Active class participation is an important part of Finance 751, and will be a\ncomponent in the calculation of the final mark.\n\n1\n\n\fStudents who do not have presentation responsibility for the week are required to hand in at\nleast two questions for each paper presented (typed!). Examples of appropriate questions may\nrelate to the motivation of the paper, or a specific detail of the methodology used. Alternatively\nyou may have a query as to the relevance of the research to New Zealand or a possibility of\nconducting similar research using a different data set. The discussion questions are part of your\nparticipation mark. Overall participation accounts for 10% of your final grade.\nThere is also a Group Assignment, details of which will be announced later. The assignment\nmay also be presented in class and accounts for 15% of your final grade.\n\nFinal Exam\nThe final exam will be open-book / open-notes and two-hours long. The time and venue for the\nexam will be announced later. The final exam accounts for 55% of your final grade.\n\nTeaching Staff\nDr Helen Lu (Course co-ordinator)\nRoom 555, Owen G.

The work that a student submits for\ngrading must be the student's own work, reflecting his or her learning. Where work from other\nsources is used, it must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This requirement also applies\nto sources on the world-wide web. A student's assessed work may be reviewed against\nelectronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request,\nstudents may be required to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised\nreview.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the University of Auckland\u2019s\nExamination Regulations (see University Calendar, General Statutes and Regulations).\nWhat is cheating?\nTo cheat in the context of university assignments and examinations is to attempt to gain an\nunfair advantage by violating the principles of intellectual and scholarly integrity. To cheat is\nto be intellectually dishonest by passing off as your own work that which has been done by\nsomeone else. To cheat is also unjust in that it devalues the grades and qualifications gained\nlegitimately by other students. All students and staff have a responsibility to prevent, discourage\nand report cheating.\nCheating may take various forms, some of which are:\n\uf0b7 Copying from another student during a test or examination. This is cheating whether or not\nthere is collusion between the students involved. Collusion with another student who wishes to\ncheat from you exposes both parties to penalties under University Regulations.\n\uf0b7 Using the work of other scholars or students when preparing an assignment or writing an\nexamination, and pretending it is your own work by not acknowledging where it came from.\nThis is called plagiarism and is outlined in a separate section below.\n\uf0b7 Copying from another student\u2019s on-course work whether that copying is with or without the\nknowledge of that student. This includes:\n\uf0d8 Copying all or part of someone else\u2019s assignment\n\uf0d8 Allowing someone else to copy all or part of your assignment\n\uf0d8 Having someone else do all or part of an assignment for you\n\uf0d8 Doing all or part of someone else\u2019s assignment for them.\n\uf0b7 Impersonating someone else in an examination, or arranging such impersonation.\n\uf0b7 The use of forbidden material in a test or examination, whether printed or in electronic form.\nFor example, the attempted use of a non-standard calculator in a restricted calculator\nexamination.\n\nWhat is plagiarism?\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. A definition of plagiarism is: \u201cThe deliberate copying of\nanother person\u2019s material and the presentation of it as one\u2019s own\u201d. Plagiarism is the inclusion\nin your work of material closely copied or paraphrased from someone else\u2019s writings (including\nwork by other students or material off the internet) without explicit indication of the source of\nthe material, that is, not referencing. Any material downloaded from the internet must have the\n\n3\n\n\fsource properly acknowledged (such as a reference and URL in the bibliography). Plagiarism\nis not acceptable in any written work presented for assessment.\nHow to avoid plagiarism\nThe work and the ideas of other people must be acknowledged by correct referencing\nprocedures. While students are encouraged to consult expert opinion, particularly in the form\nof books and journals and websites, to assist them in better understanding and in the completion\nof their assignments, such opinion must be acknowledged by explicit reference to the work\nconsulted. In this course, students are encouraged to work collaboratively with another and this\nis an important part of the University experience. However, within the particular permission\ngranted in this course to submit in pairs, it is also expected that the submitted work reflects the\nstudent\u2019s own understanding of the topic. If in any doubt about any of these issues, you should\ntalk with a staff member to clarify your concerns.\nPreventing cheating\nTypically students cheat because they are having difficulty with the course content, the\nlanguage of the course or both. Cheating and/or plagiarism can be a temptation when students\nare having difficulty with a heavy workload in the course and seek to save time by copying\nothers work. The University provides many services to help students do better or to make\nthoughtful decisions about whether to continue. Within the Department, students should first\nseek help from the lecturer. Outside the Department, the University offers help at the Student\nLearning Centre, and the English Language Acquisition Programme offers a range of courses\nto assist students whose first language is not English. There is a difference between getting help\nand cheating. The former is directed towards assisting you to understand the material and the\nassignment questions so that you are in a better position to create your own answers. Cheating\ninvolves supplying or being supplied with other people\u2019s answers.\nCLASS REPRESENTATIVE\nThe course is entitled to a class representative. The class representative will freely discuss any\nstudent concerns with the lecturer. The representatives are also invited to staff/student\nconsultative meetings if these are operative. This is the appropriate forum for raising any\nunresolved concerns you have about the running of the paper. Student representatives will be\nmade known to the class as a whole.\nWe emphasise \u201cunresolved concerns\u201d since most problems can be resolved very simply by\napproaching the lecturer concerned (or any of the teaching staff). We are there to help.\nPROGRAMME AND COURSE ADVICE\nStudents passing this course will have the necessary knowledge to complete the more\nspecialised discipline specific courses in the Honours, PGDipCom, and Masters programmes at\nThe University of Auckland. The course also provides a foundation for students wishing to\npursue further higher studies, such as in a doctoral programme.\n\n4\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MARKET722.pdf", "text": "The University of Auckland Business School\nCourse Outline 2009\nMARKET 722: SPECIAL TOPIC: BUSINESS TO BUSINESS\nMARKETING (10 POINTS)\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCourse Prescription\nThis paper is designed to develop an appreciation and understanding of marketing\ntheory and application relating to business to business marketing.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: Market.713 or BusAdmin. 762 or equivalent.\n\nGoals of the Course\nTo provide students with a sound conceptual understanding of marketing with\nparticular reference to business to business organisations; and how such concepts\ncan be used to bring about improvement in personal and organisational\nperformance.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents will be able to evaluate and explain in terms of contemporary theory\nand practice:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nThe distinctive characteristics of business to business marketing\nThe nature of buying practices, relationships and networks\nThe role of technology, innovation and NPD\nStrategy development and implementation in the business to business\ncontext.\n\nContent Outline\nIntroduction & overview\nBusiness to business vs. business to consumer\nRole of technology\nNew product and service development\nTransactions, relationships and networks\nStages vs. states of relationships\nSegmentation and implementation\nRelationship marketing and key account management\nGain vs. retain customers\nLifetime value\n\n\fLearning and Teaching\nThis course is taught in 18 hours over a two week period in Quarter 2:\nDay\n\nTime\n\nWednesday 21st January\n\n5:30-8:30 pm\n\nth\n\n9-5 pm\n\nth\n\nTuesday 27 January\n\n5:30-8:30 pm\n\nThursday 29th January\n\n5:30-8:30 pm\n\nSaturday 24 January\n\nThe course process is interactive and will include a number of cases that students\nare expected to prepare for discussion and presentation in class.

Business and/or Situation understanding. \u201cFirst is developing an understanding\nof the application domain and the relevant prior knowledge and identifying the goal of\nthe KDD process from the customer\u2019s viewpoint.\u201d (Fayyad et al., 1996)\n1.1 Identify the objectives of the business and/or situation\n1.2 Assess the situation\n1.3 Determine data mining goals, and\n1.4 Produce a project plan.\n\n\f2. Data understanding. Data provides the \u201craw materials\u201d of data mining. This phase\naddresses the need to understand what your data resources are and the characteristics\nof those resources. \u201cSecond is creating a target data set: selecting a data set, or\nfocusing on a subset of variables or data samples, on which discovery is to be\nperformed.\u201d (Fayyad et al., 1996)\n2.1 Collect initial data\n2.2 Describe the data\n2.3 Explore the data, and\n2.4 Verify the data quality\n3. Data preparation. After cataloguing your data resources, you will need to prepare\nyour data for mining. \u201cThird is data cleaning and pre-processing. Basic operations\ninclude removing noise if appropriate, collecting the necessary information to model or\naccount for noise, deciding on strategies for handling missing data fields, and\naccounting for time-sequence information and known changes\u201d (Fayyad et al., 1996)\n3.1\n3.2\n3.3\n3.4\n3.5\n\nSelect the data\nClean the data\nConstruct the data\nIntegrate the data\nFormat the data\n\n4. Data transformation: \u201cFourth is data reduction and projection: finding useful\nfeatures to represent the data depending on the goal of the task. With dimensionality\nreduction or transformation methods, the effective number of variables under\nconsideration can be reduced, or invariant representations for the data can be found.\u201d\n(Fayyad et al., 1996)\n4.1 Reduce the data\n4.2 Project the data\n5. Data-mining method(s) selection: \u201cFifth is matching the goals of the KDD process\n(step 1) to a particular data-mining method. For example, summarization,\nclassification, regression, clustering, and so on, are described later as well as in Fayyad,\nPiatetsky-Shapiro, and Smyth (1996).\u201d (Fayyad et al., 1996)\n5.1 Match the goal of data mining to data mining methods\n5.2 Select appropriate data-mining method(s)\n6. Data-mining algorithm(s) selection: \u201cSixth is exploratory analysis and model and\nhypothesis selection: choosing the datamining algorithm(s) and selecting method(s)\nto be used for searching for data patterns. This process includes deciding which models\nand parameters might be appropriate (for example, models of categorical data are\ndifferent than models of vectors over the reals) and matching a particular data-mining\nmethod with the overall criteria of the KDD process (for example, the end user might\nbe more interested in understanding the model than its predictive capabilities).\u201d\n(Fayyad et al., 1996)\n6.1 Conduct exploratory analysis\n6.2 Select data-mining algorithms\n6.3 Build/Select appropriate model(s) and choose relevant parameter(s)\n7. Data Mining: \u201cSeventh is data mining: searching for patterns of interest in a particular\nrepresentational form or a set of such representations, including classification rules or\ntrees, regression, and clustering. The user can significantly aid the data-mining method\nby correctly performing the preceding steps.\u201d (Fayyad et al., 1996) This is, of course,\nthe flashy part of data mining, where sophisticated analysis methods are used to\nextract information from the data.\n\n\f7.1 Create test designs\n7.2 Conduct data mining \u2013 classify, regress, cluster, etc.\n7.3 Search for patterns\n8. Interpretation: \u201cEighth is interpreting mined patterns, possibly returning to any of\nsteps 1 through 7 for further iteration. This step can also involve visualization of the\nextracted patterns and models or visualization of the data given the extracted models.\u201d\n(Fayyad et al., 1996) We assess and evaluate the models and the results and their\nreliability. \u201cYou are ready to evaluate how the data mining results can help you to\nachieve your objectives.\u201d (SPSS, 2007)\n8.1\n8.2\n8.3\n8.4\n8.5\n\nStudy the mined patterns\nVisualize the data, models, and patterns\nInterpret the patterns\nAssess and evaluate models\nIterate prior steps (1 \u2013 7) as required\n\n9. Action: \u201cNinth is acting on the discovered knowledge: using the knowledge directly,\nincorporating the knowledge into another system for further action, or simply\ndocumenting it and reporting it to interested parties. This process also includes\nchecking for and resolving potential conflicts with previously believed (or extracted)\nknowledge.\u201d (Fayyad et al., 1996) \u201cNow that you\u2019ve invested all of this effort, it\u2019s time\nto reap the benefits. This phase focuses on integrating your new knowledge into your\neveryday business processes to solve your original business problem and/or situation.\u201d\n(SPSS, 2007)\n9.1\n9.2\n9.3\n9.4\n9.5\n9.6\n\nPlan the deployment\nImplement the plan\nMonitor the implementation\nMaintain the implementation\nProduce a final report\nReview the project\n\n_________________\n\n\fINFOSYS 722 \u2013 Lecture and Lab Readings, Videos and Materials\nData Mining Basics: Steps 1 - 9 using SPSS Modeller\n\nWeek 1\n\nLangley, A., Mintzberg, H., Pitcher, P., Posada, E., & Saint-Macary, J.\n(1995).

Contact the Course Coordinator for questions on assignment marks\nand / or mid-term test marks. If you dispute a mark, you must make contact within one\nweek of the mark being posted on CANVAS, or the mark will stand.\n\nCheating / Plagiarism in Examinations and Coursework\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarized from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerized detection mechanisms\nsuch as \u201cTurnitin\u201d. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an\nelectronic version of their work for computerized review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, please ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the\nStudent Learning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for\nfurther information about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: http://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance.\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\nIn the event of an unexpected disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions, the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via Canvas and the University website.\nLate Submissions and Special Consideration\nFor any queries about the programme policies around the late submission of assignments,\nor for special consideration or aegrotat processes, please contact the Programme Manager.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/OPSMGT757.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2016\nOPSMGT 757: PROJECT MANAGEMENT (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1163)\nCourse Prescription\nDiscusses tools and techniques for managing complex projects. Particular focus is given\nto balancing competing demands among scope, time, costs, and quality. Communication\ntools for facilitating relationships between the project team and customers are also\ndiscussed. Both qualitative and quantitative tools for risk assessment, mitigation, and\nmanagement are covered.\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nThe course is intended as a second course in project management. It is assumed the\nstudent understands mechanical elements such as how to construct GANTT charts, PERT\ncharts, allocate resources, the 80 hour rule, etc. This course is about exploring the softer\nside of project management and about pushing into the role of the project manager (not\nthe subfunction leader or project administrator). The project manager does not sit and\ncrunch numbers.

It will also explore financial intermediation,\nmodels of financial crisis, and links between financial intermediation to the real economy.\nThe first part of the course will rigorously develop the details of consumer decision-making\nunder uncertainty and use this general framework as a basis for understanding asset\npricing, including the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the consumption capital asset\npricing model (CCAPM), and Arrow-Debreu theories.\nThe second part of the course will introduce students to some key models in the economics\nof banking and financial crises.\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: ECON 201 Microeconomics. MATH 208 (or 250) is highly recommended.\nMathematical analysis is important to fully appreciate the subject matter. Accordingly, the\nlectures and tutorials will assume that students are comfortable with calculus, static\noptimization, and statistical concepts of the sort that is typically covered in most first (and\nsometimes second) year university courses in mathematics.\nThis course complements ECON 301 Microeconomics, ECON 352 International Finance. It\nalso complements courses like FINANCE 361 Modern Investment Theory and\nManagement*, FINANCE 362 Risk Management*, and STATS 370 Financial Mathematics*.\n*Note that, unlike courses offered by the Finance Department, the emphasis of this course\nwill be on the underlying economic foundations (micro and macro). So although some\ntopics are the same, the treatment is quite different in nature and approach.\nGoals of the Course\nThe goal of this course is to provide students with a thorough understanding of the\neconomic foundations of asset pricing and financial intermediation.\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be:\n1. familiar with the basic concepts and theoretical methods of asset pricing;\n2. familiar with concepts and models that shed light on financial intermediation and\nfinancial crises.\n\nContinued\n\n\f2.\n\nECON 351 Course Outline 2017\n\nContent Outline (Provisional)\nProvisional course outline\nWeek 1, 2:\n\nChoice under risk\n\nWeek 3,4\n\nPortfolio selection and the capital asset pricing model\n\nWeek 5:\n\nThe Consumption CAPM\n\nWeek 6:\n\nReview Lectures\n\nWeek 7:\n\nArrow-Debreu approach\n\nWeek 8:\n\nBank runs\n\nWeek 9:\n\nFinancial intermediation and the real economy\n\nWeek 10:\n\nAsset price bubbles\n\nWeek 11:\n\nMacroprudential policy\n\nWeek 12:\n\nLiquidity and contagion\n\nWeek 13:\n\nReview Lectures\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThis course will be taught in the first semester.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon\nreasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of their work\nfor computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt about\nhow to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student Learning\nCentre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further information\nabout academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: https://policies.auckland.ac.nz/policies/Policies/policydisplay-register/guidelines-for-the-conduct-of-coursework.pdf\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for the\nassignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee, where\nfurther penalties can be imposed.\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends, parents,\nSLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that can\nbe given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give a copy\nof the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work, not\nan electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if required.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\n\n\f4.\n\nECON 351 Course Outline 2017\n\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of referencing\nand how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students reference\ncorrectly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some major reference\nformats with examples.\nINCLUSIVE LEARNING\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK\nStudent feedback is encouraged in this course. During the semester, students may directly\nsubmit their feedback to the lecturer through a face-to-face appointment, or they may wish\nto submit feedback through the class representative.\nClass representatives\nAt the beginning of each semester, you will elect a class representative for the paper [1]. The\nrole of the class representative is to gather feedback from students in the course and bring\nthis to the lecturer and/or the Department. Class representatives\u2019 email addresses are\nposted on Cecil and you are encouraged to contact them with feedback relating to the\ncourse. You are also welcome to talk to the class representatives in person.\nStaff-Student Consultative Committee\nClass representatives also submit feedback to the Department of Economics Staff Student\nConsultative Committee (SSCC), which meets up to three times per semester to gain\nfeedback regarding the course. Only class representatives may attend the SSCC meetings,\nand they will ask the class for feedback before the SSCC meeting.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nAt the end of the semester, you will have the opportunity to submit an evaluation of the\ncourse in a formative feedback questionnaire.\n\n[1]\n\nAn election will not take place if the number of applicants for the class representative positions equals the\nnumber of positions available.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/INNOVENT204.pdf", "text": "Course Outline\nINNOVENT 204 UNDERSTANDING ENTREPRENEURIAL\nOPPORTUNITIES (15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 2017\nCourse Prescription\n\nApplies processes for creating, evaluating and realizing entrepreneurial opportunities.\nPresents creative and analytical approaches to engage with different stakeholders and\nmake decisions under conditions of uncertainty in a variety of entrepreneurial contexts.\nSkills to assess opportunities and associated business models and communicate a credible\nand compelling business case are introduced.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\nRestriction: INNOVENT 202\nPre-requisites: BUSINESS 101 and 102 or SCIGEN 201\nThis course is designed for undergraduate students with an interest in the early stages of\nventure creation \u2013 generating ideas and creating a potential entrepreneurial opportunity.\nMore specifically, this course will explore the process of how scientific research (ideas) are\ncommercialised (into entrepreneurial opportunities) and the components that need to be\nconsidered.\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nTo introduce students to the theory of entrepreneurial opportunity and how opportunities\nare realised in practice.

The\npurpose is to provide students with an understanding of how research is conducted in accounting and finance,\nsufficient such that they may critically evaluate the academic literature and have a foundation on which to build\ntowards carrying out their own research projects.\nGOALS OF THE COURSE\nThe course is divided into two parts. Part I covers research design issues and provides students with tools to\nevaluate the design and contribution of a research study. Part II provides students with the opportunity to evaluate\na broad cross section of accounting and finance research studies. These studies are chosen to demonstrate the\napplication of all commonly used research methods in accounting and finance, and the studies are concerned with\ntopical issues spanning major accounting and finance sub-disciplines, such as auditing, financial accounting,\nmanagement accounting, investments and corporate finance.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nStudents will get an understanding and appreciation of the research carried out in the discipline of accounting and\nfinance. They will also learn why various methods, in particular the scientific approach, are predominantly used\nin carrying out research in this discipline. Further, the knowledge learned in this course should be enough to allow\nstudents to carry out a basic research project.\nThe specific abilities that students will be able to demonstrate are as follows:\n1. evaluate accounting and finance related issues/research at an advanced level;\n2. explain accounting and finance related issues/research critically and intelligently;\n3. demonstrate verbal, written, and interpersonal communication skills, to a level where students can\ncommunicate knowledge clearly and succinctly;\n4. evaluate the benefits and role of research and advanced scholarship in the practice and the advancement of\nknowledge of accounting and finance, which will provide a desire and pathway to continue learning at higher\nlevels.\nLEARNING RESOURCES\nTexts and other useful references\nThe textbook for this course is \u201cResearch methods in business studies: A practical guide \u2013 Fourth edition\u201d, by\nPervez Ghauri and Kjell Gronhaug (Prentice-Hall, 2010). The text provides readings that supplement and add to\nthe material that is taught in this course, and which will provide a useful reference for your future studies at\npostgraduate level. Other readings will be handed out in advance of each class. The main library also has a\ncollection of research method textbooks that you might find as useful references.\nThe main library also has a subject librarian for accounting and finance.

Although\noverlapping, each sub-discipline has its own special research issues. For example, one might ask: What is the\neffect of financial accounting data on share prices?; What incentive compensation arrangement best motivates\nmanagers to act in the best interests of shareholders?; What factors affect the quality of auditors\u2019 judgements\nregarding the ability of a client to continue as a going concern?; What factors affect the relation between a firm\u2019s\ncapital structure and its cost of equity capital?; or What is the effect of a change in dividend policy on a firm\u2019s\nshare price? Identify questions, such as those above, that relate to the sub-discipline and that have been addressed\nin the accounting or finance literature. Journals that you are strongly recommended to search include: Accounting\nand Finance; Accounting, Organizations and Society; The Accounting Review; Journal of Accounting and\nEconomics; Journal of Accounting Research; Contemporary Accounting Research; Journal of Business Finance\nand Accounting; Management Accounting Research; Journal of Finance; Journal of Financial Economics;\nJournal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis; Pacific Accounting Review; and Review of Financial Studies.\nBegin your search with the most recent issues of each journal and work your way back until you find 10 articles\naddressing questions in your sub-discipline. Your taxonomy\u2019s reference list should record the 10 articles\nalphabetically by author consistent with the style of the APA, Journal of Accounting and Economics or Journal\nof Financial Economics. Skim your articles simply to identify research issues addressed and the methods used to\naddress them. Do not confuse yourself by trying to understand any theoretical modelling, statistical analysis or\nanything else in the article. Simply (but carefully) identify the research question and method/design as input to\nyour taxonomy.\nThere are two requirements in this project. First, for the 10 articles that you choose, you are required to: (i) describe\nthe research issue/question addressed in each study, and (ii) describe how each study was carried out by identifying\naspects of the research method/design used. Second, and more importantly, you are required to thoughtfully\norganize the research issues/questions and research method/design according to any patterns or relationships that\nyou may observe (for example, the valuation consequences of management incentive compensation arrangements\ncould be addressed using any of the following methods: theoretical modelling, field/case study, laboratory\nexperiment, questionnaire survey, or quasi-experimental use of archival empirical data) and to discuss the\norganizational structure you have identified. Choose whatever format you like, but be sure to clearly identify each\nresearch issue/question addressed, the article(s) addressing it, and the research method/design aspects used. Also\nshow, where possible, how the issues/questions addressed and/or the research method/design used in your 10\narticles relate to one another. At the outset, you should describe and justify the organizational structure you have\nchosen for your taxonomy.\n\n2\n\n\fACCTG 701 / FINANCE 701\nThe results will provide you with an idea of the many interesting issues and problems that need research in an\narea of accounting or finance that interests you.\nThe taxonomy must be typed and double-spaced, use a 12 point size font, margins (top, bottom, and sides) should\nbe at least 1 inch, and should be no more than 10 pages long (Note: This includes any appendices, tables, figures,\nand the reference list). It must also be submitted to Turnitin.\nAssignment: To be handed in to Course Co-ordinator by 0900 Monday 16 October\nYou should work individually to write an essay describing and critically evaluating one research article chosen\nfrom your taxonomy. Your essay should begin by carefully identifying and describing the research issue/question\nand hypotheses (if any) of the study. The essay should also include a discussion of the importance of the research\nissue/question. Why is it or is it not important to seek an answer to this issue/question? You should also identify\nthe research method and discuss its appropriateness. Does this method have the potential to expand our knowledge\nwith respect to the research issue/question? What are the strengths and weaknesses of this method in this context?\nThen your essay should critically evaluate the design of the study with particular attention to issues of internal,\nexternal, statistical, and construct validity. How effectively did the study deal with these issues? Finally, you\nshould describe the results of the study and carefully evaluate the appropriateness of any inferences the author(s)\ndraw from the results. At the end, you should also include a summary statement describing the degree to which\nthe study fulfilled its intended purpose and your view of the overall contribution of the study.\nThe essay must be typed and double-spaced, use a 12 point size font, margins (top, bottom, and sides) should be\nat least 1 inch, and should be no more than 10 pages long (Note: This includes any appendices, tables, figures,\nand the reference list). It must also be submitted to Turnitin.\nParticipation\nYou will earn marks for participation if you come to class having studied the reading material assigned for the\nday and if you participate in class discussion by offering appropriate/relevant comments and seeking clarification\nof important issues. The practical exercise also lies at the heart of this assessment.\nFinal Examination\nThe final examination will have a choice of essay questions covering all aspects of the course.\nCHEATING IN EXAMINATIONS AND COURSEWORK\nThe University of Auckland will not tolerate cheating, or assisting others to cheat, and views cheating in\ncoursework as a serious academic matter. The work that a student submits for grading must be the student's own\nwork, reflecting his or her learning. Where work from other sources is used, it must be properly acknowledged\nand referenced. This requirement also applies to sources on the internet. A student's assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request,\nstudents may be required to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the University of Auckland\u2019s Examination\nRegulations (see University Calendar, General Statutes and Regulations).\nWhat is cheating?\nTo cheat in the context of university assignments and examinations is to attempt to gain an unfair advantage by\nviolating the principles of intellectual and scholarly integrity. To cheat is to be intellectually dishonest by passing\noff as your own work that which has been done by someone else. To cheat is also unjust in that it devalues the\ngrades and qualifications gained legitimately by other students. All students and staff have a responsibility to\nprevent, discourage and report cheating.\nCheating may take various forms, some of which are:\n\uf0b7 Copying from another student during a test or examination. This is cheating whether or not there is collusion\nbetween the students involved. Collusion with another student who wishes to cheat from you exposes both\nparties to penalties under University Regulations.\n\uf0b7 Using the work of other scholars or students when preparing an assignment or writing an examination, and\npretending it is your own work by not acknowledging where it came from. This is called plagiarism and is\noutlined in a separate section below.\n\uf0b7 Copying from another student\u2019s on-course work whether that copying is with or without the knowledge of\nthat student. This includes:\n\uf0d8\nCopying all or part of someone else\u2019s assignment\n\uf0d8\nAllowing someone else to copy all or part of your assignment\n\n3\n\n\fACCTG 701 / FINANCE 701\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0d8\nHaving someone else do all or part of an assignment for you\n\uf0d8\nDoing all or part of someone else\u2019s assignment for them.\nImpersonating someone else in an examination, or arranging such impersonation.\nThe use of forbidden material in a test or examination, whether printed or in electronic form. For example,\nthe attempted use of a non-standard calculator in a restricted calculator examination.\n\nWhat is plagiarism?\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. A definition of plagiarism is: \u201cThe deliberate copying of another person\u2019s\nmaterial and the presentation of it as one\u2019s own\u201d. Plagiarism is the inclusion in your work of material closely\ncopied or paraphrased from someone else\u2019s writings (including work by other students or material off the internet)\nwithout explicit indication of the source of the material, that is, not referencing. Any material downloaded from\nthe internet must have the source properly acknowledged (such as a reference and URL in the bibliography).\nPlagiarism is not acceptable in any written work presented for assessment.\nHow to avoid plagiarism\nThe work and the ideas of other people must be acknowledged by correct referencing procedures. While students\nare encouraged to consult expert opinion, particularly in the form of books and journals and websites, to assist\nthem in better understanding and in the completion of their assignments, such opinion must be acknowledged by\nexplicit reference to the work consulted. In this course, students are encouraged to work collaboratively with\nanother and this is an important part of the University experience. However, within the particular permission\ngranted in this course to submit in pairs, it is also expected that the submitted work reflects the student\u2019s own\nunderstanding of the topic. If in any doubt about any of these issues, you should talk with a staff member to clarify\nyour concerns.\nPreventing cheating\nTypically students cheat because they are having difficulty with the course content, the language of the course or\nboth. Cheating and/or plagiarism can be a temptation when students are having difficulty with a heavy workload\nin the course and seek to save time by copying others work. The University provides many services to help\nstudents do better or to make thoughtful decisions about whether to continue. Within the Department, students\nshould first seek help from the lecturer. Outside the Department, the University offers help at the Student Learning\nCentre, and the English Language Acquisition Programme offers a range of courses to assist students whose first\nlanguage is not English. There is a difference between getting help and cheating. The former is directed towards\nassisting you to understand the material and the assignment questions so that you are in a better position to create\nyour own answers. Cheating involves supplying or being supplied with other people\u2019s answers.\nCLASS REPRESENTATIVE\nThe course is entitled to a class representative. The class representative will freely discuss any student concerns\nwith the lecturer. The representatives are also invited to staff/student consultative meetings if these are operative.\nThis is the appropriate forum for raising any unresolved concerns you have about the running of the paper. Student\nrepresentatives will be made known to the class as a whole.\nWe emphasise \u201cunresolved concerns\u201d since most problems can be resolved very simply by approaching the\nlecturer concerned (or any of the teaching staff). We are there to help.\nPROGRAMME AND COURSE ADVICE\nStudents passing this course will have the necessary knowledge to complete the more specialised discipline\nspecific courses in the Honours, PGDipCom, and Masters programmes at The University of Auckland. The course\nalso provides a foundation for students wishing to pursue further higher studies, such as in a doctoral programme.\n\n4\n\n\fACCTG 701 / FINANCE 701\nCONTENT OUTLINE\nThe session dates in the content outline below are approximate.

No extension will\nbe granted. There will be a severe penalty imposed on any late hand-ins up to a time\nstipulated by the lecturer. All students enrolled in the class are expected to take the\nexams on the scheduled dates.\nAn exception to this rule may be made in the case of a legitimate and pressing need to\nbe excused, such as an illness, bereavement or other emergency, at the discretion of the\nlecturer. Please contact the lecturer if you experience such a circumstance along with any\nevidence you might have.\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence. Cheating and\ncopying on tests and exams will not be tolerated. Students are not allowed to copy\nAssignments from fellow students. Any student caught doing any of the above will face\nserious penalties.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may\nbe reviewed against electronic source material using computerized detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerized review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: https://policies.auckland.ac.nz/policies/Policies/policydisplay-register/guidelines-for-the-conduct-of-coursework.pdf\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe work. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee, where\nfurther penalties can be imposed.\nThird Party Assistance with Coursework\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you. You are also\nrequired to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work, not an\nelectronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if required.\nSee www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance for the guideline.\nInclusive Learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\n3\n\n\fHelp with Academic Referencing\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\nStudent Feedback\nStudent feedback is encouraged in this course. During the semester, students may\ndirectly submit their feedback to the lecturer, or they may wish to submit feedback\nthrough the class representative.\nClass Representatives\nAt the beginning of each semester, you will elect a class representative for the course.\nThe role of the class representative is to gather feedback from students in the course and\nbring this to the lecturer and/or the Department. Class representatives\u2019 email addresses\nare posted on CANVAS and you are encouraged to contact them with feedback relating to\nthe course. You are also encouraged to talk to the class representatives in person.\nStaff-Student Consultative Committee\nClass representatives also submit feedback to the Department of Economics Staff Student\nConsultative Committee (SSCC), which meets up to three times per semester to gain\nfeedback regarding the course. Only class representatives may attend the SSCC\nmeetings, and they will ask the class for feedback before the SSCC meeting.\nCourse and Teaching Evaluations\nAt the end of the semester, you could have the opportunity to submit an evaluation of\nthe course in a formative feedback questionnaire.\n\n4\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/FINANCE351.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nFINANCE 351: ADVANCED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT (15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCourse Prescription\nThis course suits students who wish to develop a logical and consistent framework for\nsolving corporate finance problems in practical situations.

In response to student\nfeedback the assessments have changed over the years to reflect changing\nneeds and interests of students in the area of professional development and the\nmark allocation has also changed based on student feedback to better represent\nthe effort, learning and commitment required of the various assessments. In\n2012 the peer coaching assessment was introduced as an assessment and this\nhas given students the opportunity to both develop a personal career next steps\nplan and offer and receive peer coaching as part of the process. As in previous\nyears, students will be asked to complete a course evaluation to provide\nfeedback for ongoing development of this paper at the end of the course\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for\nmarking, plagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without\nexplicit acknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including\nbooks, journal articles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A\nstudent\u2019s assessed work may be reviewed against electronic source material\nusing computerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students\nmay be required to provide an electronic version of their work for computerised\nreview.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in\ndoubt about how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and\n\n\fthe Student Learning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the\nfollowing website for further information about academic referencing:\nwww.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on\nhow to avoid plagiarism. It can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the\nmarks for the assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s\nDiscipline Committee, where further penalties can be imposed.\nThird party assistance with coursework: You are encouraged to improve your\ncoursework writing skills and are permitted to seek assistance from third parties.\nHowever, you are advised that there are important limits on the amount and\ntype of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups,\nfriends, parents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and\nassistance that can be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third\nparty, you are required to give a copy of the guidelines to the person prior to\nthem helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of\nyour work, not an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed\nversion and produce it if required. A copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHelp with academic referencing: Acknowledgement of sources is an important\naspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s Referencite website provides\nstudents with a one-stop online resource for academic referencing needs.\nReferencite explains the essentials of referencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It\nalso includes practical tools to help students\u2019 reference correctly, use references\neffectively in writing, and gives fast access\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MGMT712.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2016\nMGMT 712: ADVANCED HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE\n(15 POINTS)\n\nSemester 1 (1163)\nCourse Prescription\nAdvanced analysis and skill development in selected human resource management\nprocesses.

The theme adopted in this course is to contrast the law governing more\ntraditional structures, such as partnerships, with that governing relatively new or\ndeveloping ones such as joint ventures and franchising. The extent to which certain\nobligations, such as agency and fiduciary duties, cut across these structures will be\nexamined.

It is therefore a \u201creading\u201d course\nwith a strong emphasis on student self-learning.\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1. evaluate an organisation's strategic management accounting systems in relation to\nits competitive strategy to identify its strengths and recommend improvements\nwhere appropriate;\n2. apply a structured approach to the identification and analysis of complex, openended problems;\n3. identify key issues in selected readings;\n4. use verbal and written presentation skills to present views, evaluations and\nrecommendations; and\n5. work as team members by contributing to discussions to analyse problems and to\nthe preparation and delivery of presentations.\nWhile all the learning objectives are oriented toward achieving a credit for ACCTG 321, in\nmeeting these objectives, students will have acquired knowledge and skills that are\nvaluable in the work environment.\n\n1\n\n\fContent Outline\n1. Introduction and course administration\n2. Understanding the organisation and its objectives\na) Strategic management accounting and strategy\n3. SMA techniques\na) Lean accounting systems\nb) Activity-based costing systems\nc) Benchmarking systems\nd) Adaptive performance management systems (Beyond Budgeting)\n4. Review\nLearning and Teaching\nThe learning environment is a combination of lectures and student-centred case-based\nseminars. Seminars are managed by a seminar leader whose role is that of facilitator, i.e.,\ns/he organises the learning environment and facilitates presentations and discussion\nduring seminars.\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nLectures: Lecture once a week scheduled for Monday 10am \u2013 12 noon\nSeminars: One 2 hour seminar per week. These classes are student-centred,\ncomprising team-based learning, formal and informal student presentations, and\nclass discussions.\nOut-of-class preparation: Students should be prepared to spend time regularly\noutside of the scheduled contact hours to carry out required readings and discuss\ncourse case study material with their teams. These are essential for involvement\nwith the course and it is not sufficient to only attend formal contact hours.\n\nStudents will work both as individuals and as members of teams. You will work individually\nto complete one assignment. You will also work in teams to prepare and present a case\nstudy and to discuss weekly cases first with the members of your own group and then with\nthe larger seminar group. This is consistent with the workplace, where you have to cooperate with others to achieve objectives.\nYour responsibilities to your team and the class are similar to those expected in the\nworkforce. Attending and preparing for seminars, doing your share of teamwork and\nparticipating in class discussions are all part of your responsibility to your team and to the\nclass as a whole. The quality of your preparation and participation affects not only your\nown performance but also that of the team and the class.\n\nTeaching Staff\nEmail all course queries to: acctg321queries@auckland.ac.nz\nDr. Winnie O\u2019Grady\nLecturer (and Course Coordinator)\nOffice: OGGB 5111\nTel: 373-7599 (ext 84838)\nEmail: w.ogrady@auckland.ac.nz\n\nDr. Fred Ng\nLecturer\nOffice: OGGB 5103\nTel: 373-7599 (ext 86455)\nEmail: f.ng@auckland.ac.nz\n\n2\n\n\fLearning Resources\nThere is no prescribed textbook for this course. The ACCTG321 course page lists the\nrequired readings, and is accessed via Talis Aspire. You should also attempt to widen your\nreading by referring to the main journals from which the readings for this course have\nbeen selected. These journals are available from the Library website.\nStudents must purchase the case book from the Business School Bookshop on Level 0 of\nthe Owen G Glenn Building. This is to comply with copyright regulations. Students who\nhave not purchased the case book will not have their work graded.\n\nAssessment\nThe assignment and final examination assess your ability to progress towards achievement\nof learning outcomes.

During the semester, students may directly\nsubmit their feedback to the lecturer through a face-to-face appointment, or they may wish\nto submit feedback through the class representative. A review of student feedback suggests\nthere are no substantive issues to be addressed in this course.\nClass Representatives\nAt the beginning of each semester, you will select a class representative for the paper. The\nrole of the class representative is to gather feedback from students in the course and bring\nthis to the lecturer and/or the Department. Class representatives\u2019 email addresses are\nposted on Cecil and you are encouraged to contact them with feedback relating to the course.\nYou are also welcome to talk to the class representatives in person.\nStaff-Student Consultative Committee\nClass representatives also submit feedback to the Department of Accounting and Finance\nStaff Student Consultative Committee (SSCC), which meets during the semester to gain\nfeedback regarding the course. Only class representatives may attend the SSCC meetings,\nand they will ask the class for feedback before the SSCC meeting.\nCourse and Teaching Evaluations\nAt the end of the semester, you will have the opportunity to submit an evaluation of the\ncourse in a formative feedback questionnaire.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all your\ncourses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In the\nevent of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every effort to\nprovide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\n4\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSMKT710.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nBUSMKT 710: Consultancy Practice (15 POINTS)\nQuarter 2 (1174)\n\nCourse Prescription\nDevelops the tools and frameworks required to engage in consultancy work.

We\nexplore key issues and tools related to bringing innovative new\nproducts/services/experiences to market.\nFirms often spend great resources developing new products and services only to find that\ncustomer adoption is far less or slower than expected. Sometimes the problem is that the\nfinal product fails to deliver on its promises. More often, however, the problem is marketing\nrelated; the firm might not have involved marketing activities effectively and early on to\nunderstand evolving customer needs prior to committing R&D resources, and/or might not\nhave properly estimated the product\u2019s market potential. This course will help students avoid\nsuch market failures and foster a cohesive understanding of how marketing activity at all\nphases of the innovation process can maximize the ultimate commercial success.\nMore specifically, through the use of design-thinking tools and process, the course will\naddress the aspects of developing innovations that address the aspects of desirability,\nviability and feasibility.\n\nGoals\n\nTo provide a basic understanding of, and introduction to, a market focused and designbased approach aimed at accelerating innovation.\n\n\fLearning Outcomes\n1. Expand thinking about innovation beyond the design and development of new products\nto other sources of value creation;\n2. Strengthen individual and team capabilities to identify customer needs, develop value\npropositions, and business models, and define business opportunities;\n3. Raise awareness of, and capabilities to work with, a set of core design tools.\n\nContent Outline\nModule 1: Discover & Comprehend \u2013 Desirability: what do people desire\nModule 2: Ideate & Create \u2013 Viability: what is financially viable\nModule 3: Experiment and Deliver \u2013 Feasibility: what is organisationally and technically\nfeasible\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThe marketing part of the course is based on experiential learning, i.e. you will learn about\ndesigning for desirability, viability and feasibility when actually doing it. Before each week,\neveryone should have completed the readings as well as individual and team work activities.\nStudents are expected to attend all sessions, contribute to discussions and actively\nparticipate. Due to the interactive and team-based nature of the marketing sessions in this\ncourse, these sessions will not be recorded.\n\nLearning Resources\nThe prescribed course material and articles will be available electronically on Canvas.\nStudents will need to acquire (and use) post-it notes, paper and pens so that work can be\nshared and analysed offline as well as online.\n\nTeaching Staff\nMarketing\nDr Charlotta Windahl\nDepartment of Marketing\nRoom 419, Level 4, Owen G.

The objectives of the\ncourse are to provide students with both a theoretical background and high level of technical\nknowledge of the scope and application of the most significant aspects of taxation under the\nIncome Tax Act 2007.\nThe course provides students with an opportunity to increase their research, writing and group\npresentation skills by the completion of one major seminar paper on a topic chosen by each\nstudent, which is presented to the class. The final exam requires students to apply all aspects\nof the domestic tax regime they have mastered during the course. Emphasis is therefore\nplaced on good analytical skills and presentation of researched, comprehensive and well\nreasoned solutions.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents who take and pass this course will be able to:\n1. Identify and comprehend the major aspects of the tax regimes in the Income Tax Act\n2007\n2. Analyse the policies and principles underlying those regimes\n3. Appraise and analyse the different tax treatment of comparable structures and types of\nincome and expenditure\n4. Analyse the application of the various tax regimes to business transactions for the\npurposes of providing advice and administrating the tax system\n5. Demonstrate by synthesis enhanced research, writing and presentation skills\n6. Evaluate the scope of the New Zealand tax base, the policy underpinning it and the\nreasons for exceptions to it\n\n\fLearning and Teaching\nThe Tax Base is a mix of lecturing and research and seminar-based course.\nThe course will be taught on an intensive basis over two parts of 3 days each (1 part per\nsemester) on:\n\uf0b7 Part A: Thurs \u2013 Sat, 6 \u2013 8 March 2014\n\uf0b7 Part B: Thurs \u2013 Sat, 2 - 4 October 2014\nTimes for the sessions each day will be detailed with a course contents schedule but broadly is\n9am to 5pm. It is likely that the finishing time for Saturday is earlier than 5pm.\nTeaching Staff:\nProfessor Craig Elliffe\nDepartment of Commercial Law\nThe University of Auckland Business School\n12 Grafton Road\nAuckland City\nPh 923 8990\nEmail: c.elliffe@auckland.ac.nz\nPeter Vial\nNew Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants\n12 - 16 Nicholls Lane\nAuckland City\nEmail: peter.vial@nzica.com\nMark Keating (Senior Lecturer)\nDepartment of Commercial Law\nThe University of Auckland Business School\n12 Grafton Road\nAuckland City\nPh 923 8933\nEmail: m.keating@auckland.ac.nz\nThere will also be a number of guest lecturers presenting throughout the course.\nLearning Resources\nThere is no prescribed text but it is essential that students have a copy of the Income Tax Act\n2007. In preparation of their papers, students will be expected to be able to make use of the\nappropriate library and internet resources, including but not limited to:\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand, United Kingdom, Australian and other case law;\n\n\uf0b7\n\nAcademic journals (held in the Auckland University collections or on Lexis/\nNexis);\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand Government materials, including:\n\uf0b7\n\nAll published New Zealand IRD material\n\n\f\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand Government Discussion Documents\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNew Zealand Consultative Committee Documents\n\n\uf0b7\n\nStatutory material both current and historical.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTax treaties.\n\nThere are a variety of on-line resources available that will assist students in this course. Davis\nLaw Library staff are available to assist students in accessing all on-line materials available.\nA course book will be distributed to students prior to the course. Please endeavour to read as\nmuch as you can.\n(List any prescribed or recommended textbooks, readings and other resources such as\nsoftware packages; availability of a coursebook, CECIL or other on-line resources.)\nAssessment\nThe final grade for the course is made up by the following:\nSeminar Paper (including 10% for presentation)\nAttendance and Participation in seminars\nFinal Take-home Exam\n\n50%\n10%\n40%\n\nDue to the technical nature of the Income Tax Act 2007, the course assessments test research\nand analytical skills. Each piece of written work requires students to demonstrate knowledge\nof a number of different regimes in the Act, thereby testing their depth of knowledge and\nunderstanding of the underlying policy.\nPlusage does not apply.\nPlease refer to the Postgraduate Guide 2014 for further information.\n\nSeminars:\nStudents must complete one seminar paper worth 50% each of the final mark. The grade for\nthis seminar has two components, covering both the written paper and the quality of its\npresentation.\n40% of the grade for the seminar is based upon a seminar paper of approximately 7,000\nwords. 10% of the grade is based upon the presentation of the seminar paper by the student to\nthe class in Part B of the course. The mark is based upon presentation skills, interest generated\namong the class and ability to communicate the topic clearly. The seminar and presentation\ngrades are separately assessed (meaning an excellent paper may be presented badly or a poor\npaper may be presented well \u2013 and the separate marks will reflect those differences).\nStudents must select their seminar topics from a list we provide them.\nStudents must hand in the final draft of their seminar paper to the Department on Friday\n19 September 2014 (i.e. a fortnight prior to the date of presentation in Part B). Copies of the\npapers will be distributed to all students before Part B commences.\n\n\fSeminar papers have a maximum limit of 7,000 words, which is to be strictly observed.\nStudents struggling to contain themselves within the word limits should discuss their paper\nwith one of the teachers at an early stage.\nPapers are expected to be well researched and considered works, which set out clearly their\nintended scope and deal with the subject in a well-structured fashion. Perspectives on a topic\nmay be gained from a historical or comparative analysis, or from insights provided by other\ndisciplines, eg accounting or economics. Their presentation should be of a high standard,\nsimilar to that required for submission to an academic journal. Case, text and journal citations\nshould be in the format prescribed by the Department of Commercial Law Style Guide.\nAttendance and Participation\nAttendance and participation are worth 10% of the final grade. Allocating marks to class\nparticipation reflects the desire to encourage feedback and discussion within the course. As all\nseminar papers are circulated one week before presentation, all students need to have read and\nconsidered these papers prior to the class, and be prepared to discuss them. The small size of\nthe classes encourages interaction and student participation.\nFinal Exam\nAt the completion of the course, all students will be required to complete a take-home exam\nworth 40% of their final grade. Unlike the seminars (where topics are chosen by students) the\nfinal exam will be the same for all students and will raise a number of issues and topics\ncovered during the course. Students will have two-three weeks to complete the final exam\npaper.\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: Selected Applicants with BCom, BCom(hons), LLB, LLB(hons) or similar.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSADMIN768.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nBUSADMIN 768: STRATEGY (15 POINTS)\nQuarter 4 (1178)\n\nCourse Prescription\nA case-based course addressing the nature and methods of competition, the role and\nperspective of the general manager, and the art of strategic thinking.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: 60 points from BUSADMIN 761-764 and an additional 30 points from the\nschedule of the Post Graduate Diploma in Business\nRestriction: BUSADMIN 729, 778\n\nGoals of the Course\nThis course will introduce the language and discipline of strategic thinking, as well as the\ncritical aspects of corporate, business-level, and international strategy.\nTo that end, the goals are for participants to: (1) develop better judgement, (2) master\nthe content of the course, (3) understand competitive dynamics, (4) prepare to become a\nstrategist, and (5) enjoy the course. These goals are aligned with both the University\u2019s\nand the Business School\u2019s graduate profiles.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1.

Describe their stance and approach to the process of strategy, i.e. to understand\noneself as a strategist.\n\nContent Outline\nThis course gives a broad overview of the essential aspects of strategic management at a\nlocal, national, and international level. One distinction made in the academic field of\nstrategy is between strategy content, strategy context, and strategy process. These three\ndimensions of strategy can be recognized in every real-life strategic problem. They can be\ngenerally considered as follows:\n\n\fStrategy Process: The manner in which strategies come about is referred to as the strategy\nprocess. Stated in terms of a number of questions, strategy process is\nconcerned with the how, who and when of strategy - how is, and should, strategy be made,\nanalysed, dreamt-up, formulated, implemented, changed and controlled; who is involved;\nand when do the necessary activities take place?\nStrategy Content: The product of a strategy process is referred to as the strategy content.\nStated in terms of a question, strategy content is concerned with the \"what\" of strategy what is, and should be, the strategy for the organization and each of its constituent units?\nStrategy Context: The set of circumstances under which both the strategy process and the\nstrategy content are determined is referred to as the strategy context. Stated in terms of\na question, strategy context is concerned with the where of strategy - where, that is in\nwhich organization and which environment, are the strategy process and strategy content\nembedded.\nThe week-by-week structure is as follows:\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nThe external environment\nThe internal environment\nStrategic intent or purpose\nBusiness unit-level strategy\nCorporate-level strategy\nInternational strategy\nStrategic change\nStrategy in an entrepreneurial context\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThe class meets for one three-hour session each week. Class time will be used for a\ncombination of applied discussions of case studies and/or current events in strategy. In\nadditional to attending classes, students should be prepared to spend about another six\nhours per week on activities related to this course. These activities include carrying out\nthe required readings, keeping and preparing for assignments.\n\nTeaching Staff\nDaniel Vidal, MEng, MBA, PGDip(Finance), PGArts(Psychology)\nAdjunct Associate Professor\nPhone:\nEmail:\nProfile:\nOffice:\nNotes:\n\n09 923 3283\nd.vidal@auckland.ac.nz\nhttp://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/5533.aspx\nOGGB Level 3, Room 360; Office hours: Tuesday 3:30 to 4:30pm\nPreferred method of communication with the lecturer is via email.\nFor appointments, contact the lecturer via email.\nAppointments are scheduled within the lecturer\u2019s office hours.\n\nLearning Resources\nRequired text:\nExploring Strategy: Test and Cases (10th Edition)\nG Johnson, R Whittington, K Scholes, D Angwin, P Regner\nPearson Education\n\n\fOptional text:\nEssentials of Strategic Management\nby Pitt and Koufopoulos\nSage\nThe textbooks are available from UBS.\n\nAssessment\nAssessment Type\n\nWeighting\n\nBasis\n\nDescription\n\nDue Date\n\nMid-Term Test\n\n30%\n\nIndividual\n\nClosed Book\n\nWeek 6\n\nGroup Assignment\n\n20%\n\nGroup\n\nPresentation\n\nWeek 9\n\nFinal Examination*\n\n50%\n\nIndividual\n\nOpen Book\n\nSaturday 25th November\n\nFurther details on these assessments will be provided in the first lecture and on Canvas.\nThe broad relationship between these assessments and the course learning outcomes is\nas follows:\nLearning Outcome\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nMid Term Test\nX\nX\n\nGroup Assignment\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nFinal Exam\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nCHEATING AND PLAGIARISM\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at:\n\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\n\nIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\n\n\fthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MKTG306.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nMKTG 306: ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION (15 POINTS)\nSemester 2 (1175)\nCourse Prescription\nDiscusses the elements of the integrated marketing communications mix.

These tools allow you to assess your\nknowledge of the chapters each week BEFORE the main class. Therefore, students are\nrequired to read the relevant chapters from the prescribed textbook prior to\nparticipating in each online test.\n\n2\n\n\fWe will explain the purpose and process of the optional tests in week one. The tests start\nin week two. We encourage students to sit all tests because some of the questions may\nbe reused in the two application term\u2019s tests. Tests will be open for a number of days\nso there is plenty of opportunity to sit these.\nInteractive classes\nBecause you will be already familiar with most material for that week our classes will be a\nmixture of interactive classes, group and individual exercises, guest speakers, and\ndedicated time to prepare for assessments (e.g. your team project and the Application\nTests). These 3-hour classes are held AFTER the weekly tests, and will normally have a\ndedicated portion of the time allocated for you to work in your teams. Please check Student\nServices Online to confirm the room and time.\nGuest speakers\nIn-depth examples of current New Zealand IMC practice will be delivered by guest\nspeakers. Content delivered by guest speakers will be highly relevant for your team project\n(more details below).\nInclusive learning\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face-to-face\nand/or in written form with any member of the teaching team.\nIf university or non-university matters are getting on top of you, please contact the\nUniversity Counselling Services.

We recommend that you test your\nknowledge of chapters prior to the weekly tests using the materials on this website.\nCourse book: There is no course book for this paper.\nLecture slides: All lecture slides will be available via CANVAS just before class (i.e. after\nthe weekly tests).\nLecture recordings: Classes are not recorded because of the interactive nature of our\nclasses, the team work that occurs within them and because we want to prepare you to\nbe work-ready (e.g. regular attendance, note-taking, active participation, time\nmanagement, team work). We have asked our industry partners if they record their\nclient business meetings and none of them do, staff are expected to be present at\nmeetings, in person.\nCANVAS: CANVAS will be used to communicate important information and distribute\nlecture slides and other useful material. Please note that these lecture slides form the\nframework of the classes and do not replace classes, where more material may be\npresented and where you have the opportunity to engage with the content. Please check\nCANVAS at least every Monday and Thursday.\nMarketing subject guide:\nhttp://www.library.auckland.ac.nz/subject-guides/bus/subjects/marketing.htm\nOther Resources: The library and its associated databases hold many marketing\ntextbooks and business journals that may help you in this course.

These optional tests consist of multi-choice\nquestions, which relate to the corresponding textbook chapter(s) for that week. Some of\nthese questions may form a component of the application tests later on during the\nsemester. See the Course Schedule (above) for when weekly tests take place and which\nchapter(s) you will need to read for each test. Chapters are based on the 4th edition of\nthe textbook. Please note that these tests DO NOT contribute to your final grade.\nWe will provide more details about these tests in the first class.\nTwo Application Tests (worth 30% and 35% each). Two application tests will be\nadministered in weeks 5 and 9. We will provide more details about the Application Tests in\nthe first few weeks of the course.\nIf you cannot attend the Application tests please submit an aegrotat/compassionate\npass form (see the University Calendar/Examination Regulations for the relevant\nprocedures). Links to the AEGROTAT/COMPASSIONATE information page:\nhttp://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/cs-aegrotat-and-compassionate-consideration\nBe aware that you have to apply within 7 days after the test/exam. Note: Acceptable\nreasons for missing tests/exams include documented illness of yourself or your\ndependent(s), incarceration and bereavement. Reasons such as going on vacation,\nsporting or work commitments, or getting the date and/or time of test wrong etc. are not\nacceptable. If you are disabled or have other difficulties necessitating special\naccommodation for the test/exam (e.g. a longer test time, or a separate testing room),\nplease advise the Course Coordinator as soon as possible.\nTeam Project (worth 35%) see instructions on Assignment sheet\nIn your teams, you will need to prepare a short presentation and a two-page summary\ndocument to address the marketing communication issues outlined in the client briefing.\nYou will need to provide implementable advertising and promotion solutions that the client\nshould consider. The client will judge the finalist teams in week 12 and award the winning\nteam a prize. We will provide more details about the Team Project in the first few weeks\nof the course.\nIf you are submitting your team project late, please consult the Marketing Department\nundergraduate protocol (page 7) to determine the likely impact on your grade.\n\nStudent feedback\nWe continually improve MKTG306. Three important mechanisms for this are your\nfeedback:\n\uf0b7 directly to one of the members of the teaching team\n\uf0b7 through the course and lecturer evaluations at the end of this course\n\uf0b7 on-going feedback through your class representatives\nWe cannot promise that we can implement each student\u2019s wishes with regard to\nMKTG306. What we CAN promise is that we will consider each reasonable request and\nweigh it up against our aims and experience in running this course.\n\n5\n\n\fDEPARTMENT OF MARKETING UNDERGRADUATE PROTOCOL\nWe, the Marketing Department, regard our relationship with students as very important. This is why we\nhave written this protocol which describes the key policies and practices that will help you to have a\nclear understanding of what you can expect from your lecturer and what the lecturer can expect from\nyou. In respect to this, our overriding principles are consistency and fairness in terms of how each\nstudent is treated.\nExpected workload for students\nMost undergraduate courses are worth 15 points. The University considers that a standard semester\ncourse of 15 points should represent 150 hours of study. Split across 15 weeks (12 weeks in the\nsemester, 2 weeks in the mid-semester break, plus 1 week for exam preparation), this means that the\naverage workload per course is around 10 hours per week. A typical weekly workload for a student in\na course may look like this: 2 hours of reading/preparing for classes plus 3 hours of class contact time.\nThis leaves 5 hours each week for: preparing for/working on assessments, sitting out of class\nassessments, team work, administrative time (e.g. Canvas, turnitin.com), etc.\nFull-time students generally take four courses per semester which would result in approximately 40\nhours of study-related workload each week. This workload will vary across weeks with some weeks\nrequiring more time (e.g. weeks 6 and 12).\nConsider your workload carefully before contemplating extracurricular activities, such as part-time\nwork. Lastly, prevent bottlenecks (and stress and lost marks) by planning ahead at the start of the\nsemester.\nCommunication\nCourse-Coordinators, Lecturers and Tutors will always aim to communicate with you in a timely and\nefficient manner. The main venue where the course information will be provided are lectures and\ntutorials. Additionally, the main information related to the course, such as deadlines for your\nassignments, can be found in the Course Outline. Some Course Outlines may be provided\nelectronically while others are available in hardcopy.\nWe also use CANVAS software to help students keep track of their own progress, e.g. allowing\nstudents to check their own marks on the web. Some marketing lecturers may also use CANVAS\nsoftware to:\n\u25baProvide students with unrestricted access to course materials (lecture notes, case studies and\nreference materials). Students will be able to access these materials anytime and anywhere via the\nInternet.\n\u25baKeep students informed with changes to the schedule, upcoming events, and opportunities for part\ntime marketing jobs or social events.\nPlease note that the information posted on CANVAS does not fully cover information given in lectures.\nTherefore, if you miss a class, you should ask other students whether you have missed any important\nannouncements (or materials). It is your responsibility to monitor, read, and keep up to date on all\ncourse communications.\nThe email address you have listed in CANVAS must be one that you use and check most frequently.\nThis is the address to which your course lecturers will send any important messages and updates.\nYour current mailing address and other contact details must always be kept up to date on Student\nServices Online, the University\u2019s online enrolment and student administration system. You can update\nyour personal details by logging on to Student Services Online and then clicking on \u201cUpdate your\ndetails\u201d.\nGrading\nThis is the distribution that students are graded on for undergraduate courses in the Department of\nMarketing:\n\n6\n\n\fGRADE\nA+\nA\nAB+\nB\nBC+\nC\nCD+\nD\nD-\n\nDESCRIPTION\nOutstanding\nExcellent\nApproaching Excellence\nVery good, comfortably meeting expectations\nGood, meets expectations\nGood, just meets expectations but minor problems\nAdequate, almost meeting expectations but minor problems\nAdequate, not quite meeting expectations because of problems\nJust adequate, not quite meeting expectations because of further problems\nInadequate, further problems and below expectations\nInadequate, well below expectations because of major problems\nCompletely inadequate, well below expectations because of major problems\n\n%\n90-100\n85-89\n80-84\n75-79\n70-74\n65-69\n60-64\n55-59\n50-54\n45-49\n40-44\n0-39\n\nPlease note: The grade scales are indicative only.

Therefore, you must plan your work to give yourself leeway\nso unforeseen events such as computer problems or losing an assignment do not prevent you from\nhanding the assignment in on time. Unacceptable reasons for a late assignment also include being\noverseas or other work or sporting commitments. Acceptable reasons for handing a late assignment\nmight be a longer period of illness prior to the deadline, unexpected incarceration or bereavement.\nHowever, in these circumstances you will be required to provide suitable documentation as evidence\n(e.g. a certificate from the campus Health Centre), as early as possible, but no later than the\nassignment due date.\nStudents will be penalised for handing in assignments after the due date. Below is a list of penalties\nthat can be expected:\n1 day late 10% off grade achieved by student\n2 days late 20% off grade achieved by student\n3 days late 30% off grade achieved by student\n4 days late 40% off grade achieved by student\n5 days late 50% off grade achieved by student\nNote: Assignments handed in five minutes past the deadline are considered one day late. If an\nassignment is due in on a Friday, then an assignment submitted on Monday is considered to be three\ndays late. Assignments handed in later than five days after the deadline will not be graded. Although\nthese penalties may seem harsh, their purpose is to prepare you for the expectations your employer\nwill have of you (i.e. planning your time efficiently, and meeting deadlines) while maintaining fair and\nequitable treatment of all students.\nFor group assignments, all members of the group will be awarded the same group assignment mark,\nunless the course coordinator is informed of group issues that may have adversely affected the group\nwork. Such issues must be brought to the attention of the course co-ordinator before the assignment\ndue date.\nIn group assignments where peer assessment is used, students not contributing equally to the group\neffort may be penalised. Therefore students should inform their team mates, and the teaching staff, if\nthey are unable to contribute equitably to the group assignment at any point. Once again, suitable\n\n7\n\n\fdocumentation must be given to the course co-ordinator as early as possible, but no later than the\nassignment due date.\nGrading of Assessments\nStudents can expect all mid-semester tests and assignments to be graded and returned in tutorials\nwithin two weeks (unless otherwise specified by lecturer). Your grades will be viewable on CANVAS\nas soon as they are available. Always remember to compare your grades on CANVAS with the grades\nthat are written on your test or assignments, and report any discrepancies to your lecturer or tutor\nwithout delay.\nImportance of Mid-Semester Tests and the Final Exam\nMid-semester tests provide an opportunity for students to test their individual knowledge under\ncontrolled conditions, and also allow students to practice for the final exam. The final exam is an\nintegral part of each paper and accounts for a large percentage of your final grade. Failing the final\nexam may make it very difficult to pass a paper.\nIt is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of the location, time, and date of their mid-semester tests\nand final exams. Students who miss mid-semester tests or final exams because of ill health or\nbereavement reasons may apply for an aegrotat or for compassionate consideration (see the\nUniversity Calendar/Examination Regulations for the relevant procedures). Be aware that you have to\napply within 7 days after the test/exam.\nNote: Acceptable reasons for missing tests/exams include documented illness of yourself or your\ndependent(s), incarceration and bereavement. Reasons such as going on vacation, sporting or work\ncommitments, or getting the date and/or time of test wrong etc. are not acceptable. If you are disabled\nor have other difficulties necessitating special accommodation for the test/exam (e.g. a longer test\ntime, or a separate testing room), please advise the Course Coordinator as soon as possible.\nClass Representatives\nThe Marketing Department values the role of class representatives and encourages students to act in\nthis capacity. Students are encouraged to talk to class representatives about the course. Lecturers\nreally appreciate the class representatives\u2019 feedback. This channel is used as an opportunity to make\nimprovements to the course. There are two formal class representative meetings during a semester.\nDuring these meetings, class representatives have the opportunity to talk to the lecturers and the\nundergraduate co-ordinator about the overall evaluation of the course, and provide ideas and\nsuggestions.\nDisputes\nIf you have a problem with any Marketing course, first approach your lecturer or course co-ordinator. If\nyou are uncomfortable approaching your course co-ordinator then please contact the Marketing\nDepartment\u2019s undergraduate co-ordinators.\nStudents who wish to query their final exam and/or final grade must do so through the appropriate\nchannels (for the procedure see the University Calendar/Examination Regulations). You can apply\nonly for a recount (not a remark) of your exam. Please do not contact your lecturers directly because\nthey will not be able to give out any information on final exam marks.\n\n8\n\n\fAttachment:\nCOPYRIGHT WARNING NOTICE\nThis material is protected by copyright and has been copied by and solely for the educational\npurposes of the University under licence.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking, plagiarism can\noccur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit acknowledgment. Work can be\nplagiarised from many sources, including books, journal articles, the internet, and other students\u2019\nassignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be reviewed against electronic source material using\ncomputerised detection mechanisms. Upon reasonable request, students may be required to provide\nan electronic version of their work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt about how to\nreference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student Learning Centre are good\nplaces to start. Please refer to the following website for further information about academic\nreferencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid plagiarism.\nIt can be found at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for the\nassignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee, where further\npenalties can be imposed.\nTHIRD PARTY ASSISTANCE WITH COURSEWORK\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to seek\nassistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the amount and type of\nassistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments, including group work. Third\nparties include fellow students, reading groups, friends, parents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional\nediting services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that can be\ngiven. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give a copy of the\nguidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work, not an\nelectronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if required.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s Referen\u00a9ite\nwebsite www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online resource for academic\nreferencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of referencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It\nalso includes practical tools to help students reference correctly, use references effectively in writing,\nand gives fast access to some major reference formats with examples.\n\n9\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/INFOMGMT391.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2016\nINFOMGMT 391: INFORMATION SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT\nSemester 2 (1165)\n\nCourse Prescription\n\nTo use information effectively, businesses need people who are able to leverage a strong\nset of skills in Information Technology while also interacting with others who may not\nhave these same skills.

Students will examine governance\nand management issues in various settings: SMEs, large corporations and not-for-profit\norganisations. Particular attention will be given to behavioural perspectives of\ngovernance, board-management relationships, and board leadership and structure.\nThrough their participation in this course, students will also become familiar with, and be\nable to apply, the tools of organisational analysis.\n\nGoals of the Course\n1. To encourage students understanding of the many, often conflicting, schools of\nthought, by comparing, combining, and connecting various perspectives;\n2. To challenge their acquired knowledge about the world of organisations, by critically\nreflecting on existing patterns and new developments;\n3. To install critical, innovative and analytical thinking, by creating the specific learning\nenvironment for creative debates and critical evaluation of research and business\npractice.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nOn completion of the course student will be able to:\nLO1 demonstrate familiarity with the advanced concepts, theoretical perspectives,\nempirical findings, and contemporary trends in governance literature and practice;\nLO2 use the concepts, language, and major theories of the discipline to account for\ngovernance phenomena; that is students should be able to:\na. Identify paradoxes, trade-offs and contingencies in contemporary governance\nresearch,\nb. Interpret contemporary governance and management issues at an appropriate\nlevel of complexity,\nc. Use theories to explain major transformations in governance practice of modern\norganisations,\nd. Integrate theoretical perspectives to produce comprehensive and multi-faceted\nexplanations;\nLO 3 Explain major governance and management paradigms. In particular:\na. Compare and contrast major paradigms (e.g., shareholder value paradigm and\nstakeholder value paradigm),\nb. Compare and contracts major governance systems (e.g., Anglo-American,\nJapanese and German systems),\nc. Explain the key drivers of the current paradigm shifts,\n\n\fd. Understand how contemporary organisations learn to live with paradox, with\nconflicting goals and technologies, absorbing new rules and methods (e.g.,\ngovernance and management in knowledge-intensive firms);\nLO4 communicate effectively in a variety of formats, such as class discussions, debates,\nlectures, and group exercises;\nLO5 exhibit the ability to collaborate effectively;\nLO6 demonstrate information competence and the ability to collect, evaluate, select and\nanalyse various qualitative and quantitative data from various sources (newspapers,\nbusiness magazines, academic journals, books, internet etc.);\nLO7 understand how to implement their knowledge and skills in revealing real\ngovernance and management issues of contemporary organisations;\nLO8 understand governance and management issues from multiple perspectives;\nLO9 perform organisational analysis, by utilising historical data, structural data, process\ndata, and interpretative data.\n\nContent Outline\nIn 2016, our course is organised around four topics. The selected topics represent broad\nconcepts, issues or developments, which characterise governance and management\nphilosophies of contemporary organisations. Discussion topics emerge from the need of\nunderstanding theoretical underpinnings, historical milieus and new developments in\ngovernance and management of modern organisations. Four selected topics are:\n1. Theoretical underpinnings of governance\n2. National systems of corporate governance\n3. Board of directors\n4. Governance issues in specific organisational contexts\n\nLearning and Teaching\nThis course will be taught in Semester 1. The anticipated class size should not exceed 20\nstudents. We will meet on Fridays (9am-12pm). There will be three hours of class\ndiscussion every week. Students are expected to do prescribed readings and actively\nparticipate in the discussions. Your role, as students/discussants, is to present, analyse,\nand criticise the course materials and field experiences. My role, as teacher, is to\nfacilitate class discussions, clarify certain points, challenge your points of view and\nactively join the debates.\n\nTeaching Staff:\nDr Ljiljana Erakovic\nOwen G Glenn Building, Room 471\nPhone: 373-7599 ext. 86855\nEmail: l.erakovic@auckland.ac.nz\nOffice Hours: By appointment\n\nLearning Resources\nAll required readings are provided on the Talis course reading system.

You will not\nbe able to contribute if you don\u2019t show up! If you miss a class please let the\nkaiako (teacher) know by email as a courtesy.\n\nAssignment 1 (60%=report 30% + presentation 20% + personal reflection 10%)\n\uf0b7 Working in teams this assignment is an opportunity to contribute to the\ncommunity. The students of the class will be randomly divided into 6 teams and\neach team has about 4 members (there will be one team with 5 members\nbecause we have totally 25 students in our class).\n\uf0b7 Each team will be required to identify a particular management issue related to\ntheir own work in education, health, business, and the like, and then turn the\nmanagement issue into a research topic.\n\uf0b7 The research topic could be the evaluation of the current situation or the forecast\nfor the future of this particular management issue. Examples of resear5ch topic\ncould look like: The enrolment rate of Maori students in high school (or\nuniversities) in 2020; Implications of the rate of election participation of Maori in\nAuckland (New Zealand), Relationships of income and life satisfaction of Maori.\n\uf0b7 Each team is expected to present its research topic to and have discussions with\nkaiako (teacher) via email and the topic should be finalised before 8:30pm\nWednesday 8 Feb.\n\uf0b7 This research project could make use of the datasets provided by Independent\nMaori Statutory Board which can be found at www.imsb.maori.nz. Students can\nalso use their own data from other organisations.\n\uf0b7 The research project should be completed based on quantitative data analysis by\nusing one or more methods taught in this course.\n\uf0b7 The final format of this research project is a report, which contains a cover page,\nexecutive summary (up to 1 page), illumination and background of research\nquestion (up to 2 pages), data presentation and explanation (figure or table are\nacceptable) (up to 2 pages), analyses of the data (up to 2 pages), conclusions\nand recommendations as the results of your analyses (up to 2 pages), and\nbibliography.\n\uf0b7 There should be personal reflections (up to 1 page) of each team member\naffiliated to the report. The personal reflection should clarify your own role and\ncontribution to this assignment and what you learned in this process. Critically\ndiscuss how useful is this assignment in advancing your professional practices.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe report compiled with the personal reflections should be submitted in both\nelectronic and hard copy to the kaiako (teacher) no later than 8:30pm\nWednesday 15 March 2017.\nEach team should present your research project report for a 15-20 minutes for\nthe class on Wednesday 22 March 2017.\nThe presentation should be supported by powerpoint slides and in an engaged\nand interactive way (hopefully all the team members will play a role in the\npresentation). Electronic version of powerpoint should be handed in after the\npresentation.\nYour mark for assignment 1 consists of three parts: Report worth 30%;\nPresentation worth 20%; Personal reflection worth 10% (totally 60%).\nYour classmates will grade team presentation based on the criteria below (the\ngrade is for the team rather than for individual team members). The grades of\nyour classmates for your team will be averaged and equally distributed to the\nmembers of this team, which will account for 50% of your mark for the\npresentation of this assignment. My own grade will be the other 50% using the\nsame criteria for the team presentation.\nThe assignment will be explained further in the class of Week 3. \u00a0\n\nGrading criteria for team project presentation\nTeam #:\n1. Relevance of the topic to Maori community\n(10 points)\n2. Quality of the data used (10 points)\n3. Methods of data analysis (20 points)\n4. Reliability of conclusions (30 points)\n5.Usefulness of recommendations (20 points)\n6.Collaboration of team members (10 points)\n\nAssignment 2 (15%)\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nThis is an in-class open-book test which will last for about 20 minutes.\nQuestions include multiple choice, true or false judgement about the concepts or\nmethods lectured in the previous weeks.\n\nAssignment 3 (15)\n\uf0b7 This is an in-class open-book test which will last for about 30 minutes.\n\uf0b7 Questions include multiple choice about the concepts or methods lectured in the\nprevious weeks and a short essay (no more than 500 words) to demonstrate your\nmastery of readings and critical thinking skills in using quantitative analysis.\n\nNote\u00a0on\u00a0late\u00a0assignments:\u00a0\u00a0\nArohamai tatou katoa regarding all of our busyness! However, \u201cwork pressures\u201d or\nbusiness or personal travel are not accepted as valid reasons for lateness. The need to\nsubmit an assignment late is, however, recognised where there is evidence based on\ncompassionate or medical grounds. Late assignments where medical or compassionate\ngrounds do not apply will receive a grading penalty. There will be plenty of opportunities\nin class to talk about assignments with me and with each other!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\nThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/MKTG302.pdf", "text": "Course Outline 2017\nMKTG 302: ADVANCED MARKETING RESEARCH (15 POINTS)\nSemester 1 (1173)\nCourse Prescription\nThis course focuses on the more technical components of marketing research analysis and\nreporting.

The date and time of this exam is to be\nadvised. The exam will require students to demonstrate their knowledge of the concepts\ndiscussed throughout the course. Exam format to be advised.\nCanvas System\nAll assignments and announcements will be published during the semester via Canvas.\nMake sure to check Canvas regularly.\nPlease refer to the Department of Marketing Undergraduate Protocol at the end of this\ncourse outline for further information regarding Department polices.\n\n5\n\n\fDEPARTMENT OF MARKETING UNDERGRADUATE PROTOCOL\nWe, the Marketing Department, regard our relationship with students as very important. This is why we\nhave written this protocol which describes the key policies and practices that will help you to have a\nclear understanding of what you can expect from your lecturer and what the lecturer can expect from\nyou. In respect to this, our overriding principles are consistency and fairness in terms of how each\nstudent is treated.\nExpected workload for students\nMost undergraduate courses are worth 15 points. The University considers that a standard semester\ncourse of 15 points should represent 150 hours of study. Split across 15 weeks (e.g. 12 weeks in the\nsemester, 2 weeks in the mid-semester break, plus 1 week for exam preparation), this means that the\naverage workload per course is around 10 hours per week. A typical weekly workload for a student in a\ncourse may look like this: 2 hours of reading/preparing for classes plus 3 hours of class contact time.\nThis leaves 5 hours each week for: revision, working on assessments, sitting out of class assessments,\nteam work, administrative time (e.g. Canvas, turnitin.com), etc.\nFull-time students generally take four courses per semester which would result in approximately 40\nhours of study-related workload each week. This workload will vary across weeks with some weeks\nrequiring more time (e.g. weeks 6 and 12).\nConsider your workload carefully before contemplating extracurricular activities, such as part-time work.\nLastly, prevent bottlenecks (and stress and lost marks) by planning ahead at the start of the semester.\nCommunication\nCourse-Coordinators, Lecturers and Tutors will always aim to communicate with you in a timely and\nefficient manner. The main venue where the course information will be provided are lectures and\ntutorials. Additionally, the main information related to the course, such as deadlines for your\nassignments, can be found in the Course Outline and on Canvas.\nWe also use Canvas software to help students keep track of their own progress, e.g. allowing students\nto check their own marks on the web. Some marketing lecturers may also use Canvas software to:\n\u25baProvide students with unrestricted access to course materials (lecture notes, case studies and\nreference materials). Students will be able to access these materials anytime and anywhere via the\nInternet.\n\u25baKeep students informed with changes to the schedule, upcoming events, and opportunities for part\ntime marketing jobs or social events.\nPlease note that the information posted on Canvas does not fully cover information given in lectures.\nTherefore, if you miss a class, you should ask other students whether you have missed any important\nannouncements (or materials). It is your responsibility to monitor, read, and keep up to date on all course\ncommunications.\nGrading\nThis is the distribution that students are graded on for undergraduate courses in the Department of\nMarketing:\nGRADE DESCRIPTION\nA+\nOutstanding\nA\nExcellent\nAApproaching Excellence\nB+\nVery good, comfortably meeting expectations\nB\nGood, meets expectations\nBGood, just meets expectations but minor problems\nC+\nAdequate, almost meeting expectations but minor problems\nC\nAdequate, not quite meeting expectations because of problems\nCJust adequate, not quite meeting expectations because of further problems\nD+\nInadequate, further problems and below expectations\nD\nInadequate, well below expectations because of major problems\nDCompletely inadequate, well below expectations because of major problems\nPlease note: The grade scales are indicative only. Scaling may be applied.\n\n%\n90-100\n85-89\n80-84\n75-79\n70-74\n65-69\n60-64\n55-59\n50-54\n45-49\n40-44\n0-39\n6\n\n\fAssignments\nPlease note that group and individual assignment weightings can NOT be transferred to the final\nexam/assessment.\nWhen handing in your assignments, please use the appropriate cover sheet, and please use your official\nname, as is currently used in University records. You will have considerable advance notice about the\ndate that assignments are due. Therefore, you must plan your work to give yourself leeway so\nunforeseen events such as computer problems or losing an assignment do not prevent you from handing\nthe assignment in on time. Unacceptable reasons for a late assignment also include being overseas or\nother work or sporting commitments. Acceptable reasons for handing a late assignment might be a\nlonger period of illness prior to the deadline, unexpected incarceration or bereavement. However, in\nthese circumstances you will be required to provide suitable documentation as evidence (e.g. a\ncertificate from the campus Health Centre), as early as possible, but no later than the assignment due\ndate.\nStudents will be penalised for handing in assignments after the due date. Below is a list of penalties that\ncan be expected:\n1 day late 10% off grade achieved by student\n2 days late 20% off grade achieved by student\n3 days late 30% off grade achieved by student\n4 days late 40% off grade achieved by student\n5 days late 50% off grade achieved by student\nNote: Assignments handed in five minutes past the deadline are considered one day late. If an\nassignment is due in on a Friday, then an assignment submitted on Monday is considered to be three\ndays late. Assignments handed in later than five days after the deadline will not be graded. Although\nthese penalties may seem harsh, their purpose is to prepare you for the expectations your employer will\nhave of you (i.e. planning your time efficiently, and meeting deadlines) while maintaining fair and\nequitable treatment of all students.\nFor group assignments, all members of the group will be awarded the same group assignment mark,\nunless the course coordinator is informed of group issues that may have adversely affected the group\nwork. Such issues must be brought to the attention of the course co-ordinator before the assignment\ndue date.\nIn group assignments where peer assessment is used, students not contributing equally to the group\neffort may be penalised. Therefore students should inform their team mates, and the teaching staff, if\nthey are unable to contribute equitably to the group assignment at any point. Once again, suitable\ndocumentation must be given to the course co-ordinator as early as possible, but no later than the\nassignment due date.\nGrading of Assessments\nStudents can expect all mid-semester tests and assignments to be graded and returned in tutorials\nwithin two weeks (unless otherwise specified by lecturer). Your grades will be viewable on Canvas as\nsoon as they are available. Always remember to compare your grades on Canvas with the grades that\nare written on your test or assignments, and report any discrepancies to your lecturer or tutor without\ndelay.\nImportance of Mid-Semester Tests and the Final Exam\nMid-semester tests provide an opportunity for students to test their individual knowledge under\ncontrolled conditions, and also allow students to practice for the final exam. The final exam is an integral\npart of each paper and accounts for a large percentage of your final grade. Failing the final exam may\nmake it very difficult to pass a paper.\nIt is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of the location, time, and date of their mid-semester tests\nand final exams. Students who miss mid-semester tests or final exams because of ill health or\nbereavement reasons may apply for an aegrotat or for compassionate consideration (see the University\nCalendar/Examination Regulations for the relevant procedures). Be aware that you have to apply within\n7 days after the test/exam.\nNote: Acceptable reasons for missing tests/exams include documented illness of yourself or your\ndependent(s), incarceration and bereavement. Reasons such as going on vacation, sporting or work\ncommitments, or getting the date and/or time of test wrong etc. are not acceptable. If you are disabled\n7\n\n\for have other difficulties necessitating special accommodation for the test/exam (e.g. a longer test time,\nor a separate testing room), please advise the Course Coordinator as soon as possible.\nClass Representatives\nThe Marketing Department values the role of class representatives and encourages students to act in\nthis capacity. Students are encouraged to talk to class representatives about the course. Lecturers really\nappreciate the class representatives\u2019 feedback. This channel is used as an opportunity to make\nimprovements to the course. There are two formal class representative meetings during a semester.\nDuring these meetings, class representatives have the opportunity to talk to the lecturers and the\nundergraduate co-ordinator about the overall evaluation of the course, and provide ideas and\nsuggestions.\nDisputes\nIf you have a problem with any Marketing course, first approach your lecturer or course co-ordinator. If\nyou are uncomfortable approaching your course co-ordinator then please contact the Marketing\nDepartment\u2019s undergraduate co-ordinators:\n\uf0b7 Dr Catherine Frethey-Bentham (OGGB, level 4, phone: 373 7599 Ext. 88830, e-mail:\nc.bentham@auckland.ac.nz) or\n\uf0b7 Dr Rebecca Dolan (OGGB, level 4, phone: 373 7599 Ext. 86984, e-mail:\nrebecca.dolan@auckland.ac.nz).\nStudents who wish to query their final exam and/or final grade must do so through the appropriate\nchannels (for the procedure see the University Calendar/Examination Regulations). You can apply only\nfor a recount (not a remark) of your exam. Please do not contact your lecturers directly because they\nwill not be able to give out any information on final exam marks.\n\n8\n\n\fAttachment:\nCOPYRIGHT WARNING NOTICE\nThis material is protected by copyright and has been copied by and solely for the educational purposes\nof the University under licence.

In coursework assignments submitted for marking, plagiarism can\noccur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit acknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised\nfrom many sources, including books, journal articles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments.

The\nobjectives of the course are to provide students with both a theoretical background and high\nlevel of technical knowledge of the scope and application of the most significant aspects of\ninbound and outbound investment under the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Double Tax\nAgreements. Where appropriate, a comparison is made with the international regimes of our\nmajor trading partners, in order to provide a deeper understanding of the policy behind New\nZealand\u2019s international tax regime.\nThe course provides students with an opportunity to increase their research, writing and group\npresentation skills by the completion of one major seminar paper on a topic chosen by each\nstudent, which is presented to the class. The final exam requires students to apply all aspects\nof the international tax regime they have mastered during the course. Emphasis is therefore\nplaced on good analytical skills and presentation of researched, comprehensive and well\nreasoned solutions.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents who take and pass this course will be able to:\n1. Identify and comprehend the major aspects of the international tax regime in the\nIncome Tax Act 2007\n2. Analyse the policies and principles underlying those regimes\n3. Appraise and analyse between the different tax treatment of comparable structures\nand types of income and expenditure\n4. Analyse and evaluate the application of the international tax regimes to business\ntransactions for the purposes of providing advice or administering the tax system\n\n\f5.

The mark is based upon presentation skills, interest\ngenerated among the class and ability to communicate the topic clearly.

Copies of the papers will be\ndistributed to all students before Part B commences.\nSeminar papers have a maximum limit of 7,000 words, which is to be strictly observed.\nStudents struggling to contain themselves within the word limits should discuss their paper\nwith Professor Elliffe at an early stage.\nPapers are expected to be well researched and considered works, which set out clearly their\nintended scope and deal with the subject in a well-structured fashion. Perspectives on a topic\nmay be gained from a historical or comparative analysis, or from insights provided by other\ndisciplines, eg accounting or economics. Their presentation should be of a high standard,\nsimilar to that required for submission to an academic journal. Case, text and journal citations\nshould be in the format prescribed by the New Zealand Law Style Guide. Grades will be\n\n\fawarded in accordance with the Department\u2019s policy \u201cThe Basis for Assessment of Legal\nWriting\u201d.\nAttendance and Participation\nAttendance and participation are worth 10% of the final grade. Allocating marks to class\nparticipation reflects the desire to encourage feedback and discussion within the course. As\nall seminar papers are circulated one week before presentation, all students need to have read\nand considered these papers prior to the class, and be prepared to discuss them. The small\nsize of the classes encourages interaction and student participation.\nFinal Exam\nAt the completion of the course, all students will be required to complete a take-home exam\nworth 40% of their final grade. Unlike the seminars (where topics are chosen by students) the\nfinal exam will be the same for all students and will raise a number of issues and topics\ncovered during the course. Students will have two-three weeks to complete the final exam\npaper.\nSuggested seminar topics\nStudents are expected to demonstrate a high level of knowledge regarding the application of\nthe Income Tax Act 2007 and Double Tax Agreements to their chosen seminar topic.\nStudents must be able to demonstrate an understanding of the policy and structure of the New\nZealand international tax regime.\n\uf0b7\n\nThe extraterritoriality of taxation and the inter-nation allocation of tax revenue\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe relationship between Double Tax Agreements and domestic legislation with\nrespect to the role of CFC legislation\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe relationship between Double Tax Agreements and domestic legislation with\nrespect to domestic law override\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe relationship between Double Tax Agreements and domestic legislation with\nrespect to section GB 1\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe taxation of business profits and the concept of permanent establishments\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe interpretation of Double Tax Agreements\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe history of New Zealand\u2019s taxation of foreign profits\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTreaty shopping (withholding tax and interposed entities)\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTax havens\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTransfer pricing\n\n\uf0b7\n\nHuman endeavour and tax treaties (employment and services income, pensions, etc)\n\n\f\uf0b7\n\nTransport operators (domestic regimes and tax treaties)\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNon-resident entertainers (domestic regimes and treaties) and non-resident film renters\n\n\uf0b7\n\nForeign tax credits\n\n\uf0b7\n\nControlled Foreign Companies\n\n\uf0b7\n\nForeign Investment funds\n\n\uf0b7\n\nForeign Trusts\n\n\uf0b7\n\nNon-resident insurers\n\n\uf0b7\n\nThe collection of foreign taxes\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\nPrerequisite: Selected Applicants with BCom, BCom(hons), LLB, LLB(hons) or similar.\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}, {"url": "http://www.courses.business.auckland.ac.nz/CoursePdfs/BUSADMIN776.pdf", "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nCourse Outline 2017\nBUSADMIN 776: Operations and Supply Chain Management (15 points)\n\nQuarter 3 (1176)\n___________________________________________________________\nCourse Prescription\n\nFocuses on the development of important managerial skills needed to ensure the\ncontinuing effective contribution of an enterprise's productive processes and information\nsystems to its competitive position and performance. Emphasises learning about the\ncomplex operations and infrastructure required for (1) product development and\nmanufacture and (2) service design and delivery.\n\nProgramme and Course Advice\n\nPrerequisite: BUSADMIN 773\nRestriction: BUSADMIN 766, OPSMAN 703\n\nGoals of the Course\n\nOperations and Supply Chain Management deals with the processes through which\norganisations create and distribute products and services (outputs), utilising resources\nincluding labour, materials, equipment, capital, information, and technology (inputs).\nThese processes must be designed, controlled, and improved to meet a variety of\nperformance objectives, taking into account constraints and uncertainty in the internal and\nexternal environment.\nThe goals of the course are for students to be able to:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nunderstand and analyse the role of operations and supply chain management \u2013 in\nmanufacturing and services;\nunderstand key trade-offs involved in operations and supply chain management\nand how they relate to an organisation\u2019s strategy and competitive position; and\nutilise key concepts, models, and tools to formulate and justify recommendations\nto improve operations and supply chain processes.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this course, it is expected that the student will be able to:\n1.\u00a0explain the key concepts of operations strategy and justify how operations and supply\nchain management can be used to improve the competitive position of manufacturing\nand service organisations;\n2. identify and analyse methods to match capacity and demand of products and services\nto improve performance - particularly in the face of uncertainty;\n3. generate and critique methods and implementation of quality management and\nprocess improvement - using concepts such as lean thinking and six sigma;\n4. identify supply chain and inventory management issues and provide conceptual\n(methods and ideas) and analytical (modelling) approaches to deal with them\neffectively (e.g., reducing working capital requirements and/or improving customer\nservice);\n5. articulate important linkages between operations and supply chain management and\nother areas of the firm: in particular human resources, marketing, and finance.\n\n\fContent Outline\nSession\nSession\nSession\nSession\nSession\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nIntroduction, Frameworks and Operations Strategy\nQuality Management and Process Management\nCapacity and Constraint Management. Lean Operations and Just-in-Time\nDemand Management and Inventory Management\nSupply Chain Management and Course Review\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nThe class will meet in 260-325 from 9am-3pm on three Saturdays and from 1pm-7pm on\ntwo Fridays. Class time will be used for a combination of lectures and applied discussions\nof case studies and exercises. In addition to attending classes, students should be\nprepared to spend around six hours per week on activities related to this course. These\nactivities include carrying out the required readings and assignments, viewing video\nmaterial, participating in the simulations, and preparing for the exam. Note that numerous\nexamples (mostly with model answers) from previous assignment and exams, and\nrecorded worked solutions are provided on CANVAS. There will also be a mock test\navailable half way through the course.\nThrough linked lectures, cases, videos, exercises and readings, the course will show how\noperations in manufacturing and services should establish strategy and manage resources\nand processes along with supply chain interactions. By utilising frameworks and tools and\nthinking critically and creatively, operations can solve practical problems and generate\ninnovative ideas to establish valuable organizational capabilities (including those providing\nsustainable competitive advantage) that are aligned with business strategy, and integrated\nwith marketing, people, information systems, and finance.\nA variety of instructional methods will be employed, including lecture, case discussion,\nworked examples, simulations, and video (some for a \u201cflipped classroom\u201d). The course\ncontent presents both practice (from case studies and examples in class) and\ncontemporary research (primarily from journal articles) in Operations Management and\nclosely-related fields. There are four cases in the course representing a variety of\nindustries and geographical focus.\nIt is essential to have read and reflected on the prescribed material before each session\nto ensure class discussion is well informed and productive.\nStudent feedback will be sought throughout the course \u2013 informally, via evaluation, and\nstudent representatives. I also welcome questions you may have after any session. Where\nappropriate we will answer these for the whole class in a subsequent session, and the best\nones will be recognized as a contribution to the class discussion.\nI endeavour to provide feedback on all submissions/tests within one week at the most.\nThis feedback should prove helpful for subsequent assessment. I am happy to correspond\nvia e-mail, phone, skype or in person.\n\n2\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\fTeaching Staff\nDavid Robb\nTitle:\nPhone:\nOffice:\nOffice Hours:\nEmail:\n\nProfessor of Operations and Supply Chain Management\n09-923-2812\n260-346 (overlooks Grafton Road)\nby appointment\nd.robb@auckland.ac.nz\n\nLearning Resources\n\nThe following text is optional: Cachon, G., and Terwiesch, C.

Setting the Reorder Point using Business Intelligence\n\nCheating and Plagiarism\nThe University of Auckland regards cheating as a serious academic offence.\nPlagiarism is a form of cheating. In coursework assignments submitted for marking,\nplagiarism can occur if you use the work and ideas of others without explicit\nacknowledgment. Work can be plagiarised from many sources, including books, journal\narticles, the internet, and other students\u2019 assignments. A student\u2019s assessed work may be\nreviewed against electronic source material using computerised detection mechanisms.\nUpon reasonable request, students may be required to provide an electronic version of\ntheir work for computerised review.\nThe way of avoiding plagiarism is to reference your work properly. If you are in doubt\nabout how to reference properly, ask someone \u2013 your lecturers, tutors and the Student\nLearning Centre are good places to start. Please refer to the following website for further\ninformation about academic referencing: www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/\nThe document Guidelines: Conduct of Coursework provides further advice on how to avoid\nplagiarism. It can be found at: www.business.auckland.ac.nz/conductcoursework\nThe penalties for plagiarism can be severe, including losing some or all of the marks for\nthe assignment. Major offences can be sent to the University\u2019s Discipline Committee,\nwhere further penalties can be imposed.\nWhile you are encouraged to improve your coursework writing skills and are permitted to\nseek assistance from third parties you are advised that there are important limits on the\namount and type of assistance that can be given to you in completing your assignments,\nincluding group work. Third parties include fellow students, reading groups, friends,\nparents, SLC tutors, and paid-for professional editing services.\n\n6\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\fThere is a set of guidelines which clearly indicates the type of advice and assistance that\ncan be given. If you are seeking the assistance of any third party you are required to give\na copy of the guidelines to the person prior to them helping or assisting you.\nYou are also required to only seek and accept help using a printed version of your work,\nnot an electronic version. You must keep a copy of this printed version and produce it if\nrequired.\nA copy of the guidelines is available at:\nwww.business.auckland.ac.nz/thirdpartyassistance\n\nHELP WITH ACADEMIC REFERENCING\nAcknowledgement of sources is an important aspect of academic writing. The University\u2019s\nReferen\u00a9ite website www.cite.auckland.ac.nz provides students with a one-stop online\nresource for academic referencing needs. Referen\u00a9ite explains the essentials of\nreferencing and how to avoid plagiarism. It also includes practical tools to help students\nreference correctly, use references effectively in writing, and gives fast access to some\nmajor reference formats with examples.\n\nINCLUSIVE LEARNING\nStudents are urged to discuss privately any impairment-related requirements face- toface and/or in written form with the course convenor/lecturer and/or tutor.\n\nSTUDENT FEEDBACK\nFormative feedback surveys\nDuring the early part of the quarter (usually Week 3 or 4), short feedback surveys are\nadministered to all students to get a snapshot of how they are coping with their new\ncourses. This qualitative data, which is administered, collected and collated by the\nProgramme Office, is designed as an \u2018early warning\u2019 system of any significant issues with\nthe course that might need addressing quickly.\nLecturers are asked to provide a brief report to the Director GSM MBA on key items\nidentified and proposed actions. Lecturers are also asked to provide a verbal report to\nthe class, proposing any solutions as appropriate.\nCourse and teaching evaluations\nThe University of Auckland evaluates the quality of teaching and of courses by using the\nthe Summative Evaluation Tool, or SET. Summative evaluation is formal, summative\nevaluation of teaching undertaken according to University policy and is conducted at the\nend of a semester/quarter through the use of the formal University SET instruments.\nSummative evaluation is used by teachers to reflect on their teaching practice, and is\nalso used by the University for quality assurance of teaching and courses.\n\n7\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\fIn the Event of an Unexpected Disruption\nWe undertake to maintain the continuity and standard of teaching and learning in all\nyour courses throughout the year. If there are unexpected disruptions the University has\ncontingency plans to ensure that access to your course continues and your assessment is\nfair, and not compromised. Some adjustments may need to be made in emergencies. In\nthe event of a disruption, the University and your course coordinators will make every\neffort to provide you with up to date information via canvas and the university web site.\n\n8\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\f", "university": "University of Auckland"}]
