    15 credits in autumn teaching<br/>
    Teaching method: Lecture<br/>
    Assessment modes: Unseen examination</p>
<p>In this module, you are introduced to algorithmic problem solving. Your studies in this module will answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is a problem specification, an algorithm, a computation?</li>
<li>what are their properties?</li>
<li>how does one develop an algorithm?</li>
<li>how can one rigorously argue that an algorithm computes correct solutions to a given problem?</li>
<li>how can one measure the efficiency of an algorithm and the complexity of a problem?</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the module, you use a simple algorithmic language (pseudo code) for the sake of writing algorithms - the focus of this module is on algorithmic thinking, not coding.</p>
<p>In the module, you specify and develop searching, sorting and other simple (and intuitive) algorithms. You apply and explore principles like divide-and-conquer and recursive programming.</p>
<p>You also look at two important properties of algorithms - 'correctness' and 'complexity'.</p>
<p>Algorithms should only compute correct solutions of a problem. To establish correctness, you are introduced to some relevant (propositional and predicate) logic, in an informal style (focusing on logical reasoning principles rather than logical calculi).</p>
<p>Finally, you discuss asymptotic complexity classes and explore the concept of time complexity of an algorithm.</p>
<p>As part of this module, you undertake exercise classes and coursework, based on a series of examples.</p>
<p>The algorithms you develop in this module should be implemented in Java concurrently or at a later stage in the further programming module.</p>
<h3>Module learning outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Develop an algorithm from a given problem specification.</li>
<li>Prove that a given algorithm is correct for a given problem specification.</li>
<li>Analyse a given algorithm and establish its time complexity class.</li>
<li>Spot mistakes and suggest possible improvements for a given algorithm.</li>

<h1>Computing</h1> <h2>Real-World Cognition</h2>
<p>
    Module code: 801G1<br/>
    Level 7 (Masters)<br/>
    15 credits in autumn teaching<br/>
    Teaching method: Seminar<br/>
    Assessment modes: Coursework, Unseen examination</p>
<p>This module aims to enable you to recognise the achievements and utility of cognitive science and to apply its models and methods to real-world problems. Applications of cognitive science abound in the real world.</p>
<p>For example, principles derived from cognitive science are applied to the design of information displays, educational technologies and safety equipment, amongst other things. The module provides a framework for characterising different types of problem. Knowledge of research findings from cognitive studies of language, decision making, reasoning and problem solving can help people make better decisions, make them less susceptible to the bogus claims of some advertisements and to help them adopt a more rational stance in their perceptions of risk (e.g. in the context of gambling, `stranger danger' and medical screening programmes).</p>
<p>Studies of complex problem solving give us insight into how expert performance differs from that of novices and how, for example, 'everyday' calculations in shops, markets and other real-world contexts differ from similar activities in formal educational settings. Understanding how language and cognition interact shows why some kinds of knowledge is difficult to acquire. Studies of human error show how everyday mistakes and slips occur and how they may be avoided or lessened. These are examples of the kinds of topics that can be approached from a cognitive science perspective.</p>
<h3>Module learning outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Systematically understand the broad relevance of cognitive science to problems faced in the real world.</li>
<li>Identify and apply appropriate frameworks and methods of cognitive science to real-world problems.</li>
<li>Critically evaluate real-world systems and artefacts in terms of human and task factors.</li>

<p>Few companies these days could claim to be purely domestic. While the firm may confine its activities to the domestic market, the market itself is unlikely to be so restricted and may be served by firms headquartered in or operating from a number of other countries or regions. Knowledge of international issues is therefore of importance to all firms whether they are actively involved in marketing in foreign markets or have foreign competitors at home. This module represents an introduction to international marketing and aims to develop knowledge of the international environment and international marketing. The increased scope, risk and complexity faced by the international marketer is due to the increased level of uncertainty from operating in diverse and less understood environments. Emphasis is placed on the identification of challenges presented by international marketing to equip students to deal with differences, opportunities and threats emerging from diverse economic, demographic, political/legal, cultural, technical and competitive environments. The impact of international issues is related during the module to the marketing decision-making task at three levels; the macro level at which country selection decisions are made; national level at which market entry decisions are made; and market level where marketing mix decisions are made.</p>

<p>This is a capstone module that builds upon all accounting modules studied in previous semesters. It provides insight into the ways in which accounting choice is affected by internal and external factors.

The module overviews the development of accounting and its role in society, and presents a range of theoretical perspectives of accounting choice. In doing so, it considers links between accounting theory, research and practice and, in particular, earnings management.</p>

<h1>Business and management studies</h1> <h2>Developing Leadership (LEAD)</h2>
<p>

<p>Organisations have traditionally conceived of leadership as a heroic attribute, appointing the few 'real' leaders to high-level senior positions in order to get them through the hard times. Many observers within organisations are questioning this approach and are beginning to think about the need to recognise and utilise a wider range of leadership practices. Leadership, they argue, needs to be conceived of as something that happens across functions and levels, and that is closely connected with social, cognitive and communicative skills such as those employed in negotiation and decision-making. New concepts and frameworks are needed in order to embrace this more inclusive understanding. This module adopts a systems approach, which focuses on method, people, context, and need. As such, the module offers a perspective that links the two dimensions of people and situation with two additional dimensions of process and content (methods and outcomes).</p>
<h3>Module learning outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate systematic understanding of leadership theory and its relevance to contemporary businesses</li>
<li>Devise and sustain arguments in relation to contemporary issues in leadership</li>
<li>Demonstrate coherent and detailed knowledge informed by current research of key leadership theories, approaches to leadership and negotiation in diverse contexts</li>
<li>Describe and comment on challenges faced by leaders in contemporary business</li>

<p><span>Science, technology and innovation (STI) play fundamental roles in our societies. STI are pervasive in our lifestyles and our social organisation and crucial for economic growth. However, until a few years ago science and technology had been regarded as external factors that social actors used at convenience without inquiring how they were created. </span><br/><br/><span>In this module we will explore how science and technology are shaped by social forces and how science and technology shape social phenomena. The processes by which socio-economic and technological phenomena shape each other are complex and dependent on historical circumstances. In order to try to see through this complexity we will adopt systemic approaches taking on economic and sociological perspectives.</span><br/><br/><span>Innovation system and network approaches look into how various socio-economic actors (university, small spin-off firms, large corporations, governmental agencies, activist organisations and the wider public) interact with each other. For example, these interactions may lead to knowledge transfer, may result in the construction of new regulatory regimes or may lead to political conflicts. </span><br/><br/><span>This module aims to 'open up' the black box of how science, technology and innovation (STI) to understand their emergence and show that STI can be created, directed and managed for diverse purposes, encouraging critical views on past and current STI uses.</span></p>

<p>This module will provide you with detailed theoretical and practical knowledge of how to manage change in a variety of contexts. You will examine the principles of managing change at a number of levels, building progressively throughout the module from looking at individual change, to team change, and organisational change up to complex change at the meso-macro level in complex economic systems (eg large projects of regional, or even national importance).</p>
<p>Within this continuum, topics to be addressed include: cognitive and psychodynamic theories of change, the constitution of teams and their dynamics, models and approaches to organisational change (including cultural change, restructuring, and mergers/acquisitions). The application of specific tools for change will also be a key feature of the course, including tools for planning and project management, as well as team member/stakeholder engagement techniques.</p>
<p>You will engage with theoretical concepts and real-life, empircal case material. These will form the main focus of the interactive seminars, which will employ diverse methods (role-plays, debates, presentations, team-based problem solving) to discuss case studies and to help you gain practical skills from applying tools for managing change.</p>
<p>An assessed feasibility study project will provide an opportunity to operationalise course learning towards practical tasks as well as demonstrating your understanding and process ahead of the unseen exam. The Lecture titles are:</p>

    Teaching method: Lecture<br/>
    Assessment modes: Coursework</p>
<p>In this module you have to see through an independent piece of research, starting with a research question and ending in the presentation and critique of findings.</p>
<p>To start off, you identify a strategic business issue and formulate an HR-related research question after rigorously reviewing and understanding existing research and literature.</p>
<p>You're assigned a supervisor and they work closely with you to develop the project and write up a 12,000-word Management Research Report. This must clearly outline the theoretical approach and foundations of the project, analyse data and generate well-supported insights linking theory and data. It must also recognise shortcomings and develop concrete HR-relevant proposals.</p>
<p>You are expected to draw on your entire training from the first two terms of the academic year, using both substantive and methodological knowledge from completed modules. You are then expected to develop the research project and essay based on your theoretical and empirical interests.</p>
<p>You're expected to independently work on all steps of the research and collect data as you go, although the nature of this data and how you collect it is down to you.</p>
<p>You will also deal with research access and ethics approval processes.</p>
<p>Research methods can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>face-to-face interviews</li>
<li>focus groups</li>
<li>participant and/or non-participant observation</li>
