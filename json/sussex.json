The module provides a framework for characterising different types of problem. Knowledge of research findings from cognitive studies of language, decision making, reasoning and problem solving can help people make better decisions, make them less susceptible to the bogus claims of some advertisements and to help them adopt a more rational stance in their perceptions of risk (e.g. in the context of gambling, `stranger danger' and medical screening programmes).</p>\n<p>Studies of complex problem solving give us insight into how expert performance differs from that of novices and how, for example, 'everyday' calculations in shops, markets and other real-world contexts differ from similar activities in formal educational settings. Understanding how language and cognition interact shows why some kinds of knowledge is difficult to acquire. Studies of human error show how everyday mistakes and slips occur and how they may be avoided or lessened.

While the firm may confine its activities to the domestic market, the market itself is unlikely to be so restricted and may be served by firms headquartered in or operating from a number of other countries or regions. Knowledge of international issues is therefore of importance to all firms whether they are actively involved in marketing in foreign markets or have foreign competitors at home. This module represents an introduction to international marketing and aims to develop knowledge of the international environment and international marketing. The increased scope, risk and complexity faced by the international marketer is due to the increased level of uncertainty from operating in diverse and less understood environments. Emphasis is placed on the identification of challenges presented by international marketing to equip students to deal with differences, opportunities and threats emerging from diverse economic, demographic, political/legal, cultural, technical and competitive environments. The impact of international issues is related during the module to the marketing decision-making task at three levels; the macro level at which country selection decisions are made; national level at which market entry decisions are made; and market level where marketing mix decisions are made.</p>\n<h3>Module learning outcomes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to identify sources of data on International Markets and the ability to carry out a research exercise based on secondary data sources.</li>\n<li>The ability to select relevant market information and the ability to interpret data and relate its implications to the marketing task of a particular company or product.

Leadership, they argue, needs to be conceived of as something that happens across functions and levels, and that is closely connected with social, cognitive and communicative skills such as those employed in negotiation and decision-making. New concepts and frameworks are needed in order to embrace this more inclusive understanding. This module adopts a systems approach, which focuses on method, people, context, and need.
