The purpose of the course is to encourage you to reflect on the complexities of modern organizational and social life so you may better understand how values in each of these spheres influence our interpretation of reality, how we think, what we value, and our ability to act with upon the world. This will be accomplished by taking an interdisciplinary perspective on bureaucracies, businesses, governments, and other forms of organization. We will also explore how values affect our capacity to engage in rational, deliberative thought. Rather than relying on standard management textbooks, the class uses the work of management thinkers, fiction writers, essayists, and social critics to provide alternative source material for these inquiries. The student is encouraged to reflect on the role that organizations and society play in shaping your personal values and how they are lived-out in organized life.</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>Specifically, the course has the following objectives:</p><ul><li>to encourage a critical examination of the pros and cons of modern organized life so that students will be better equipped to change or improve organizations when flaws are identified or to defend against unjustified attacks on organizations.</li><li>to encourage students to develop personal management philosophies based on an examination of organizations, leaders, and historical events from different points of view.</li><li>to illustrate complex interrelationships and connections among organizations and society and to reflect upon how these relationships impact concerned and affected parties.</li><li>to cause students to consider how organizations influence the way they think, feel, and act and how they influence organizations.</li><li>to explore the concept of human nature and the effects of work and social organization on the individual and society.</li><li>to cause to students to reflect on the moral aspects of organizational life.</li></ul><p>Note: COHR 301 will not be offered in 2017W.</p><p>Prerequisite: COMM 292 and one of COMM 203, COMM 392.</p></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    1.5  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COHR 302 - Critical Evaluation of Information, Evidence, and Arguments</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COHR 302 - Critical Evaluation of Information, Evidence, and Arguments</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>This course will provide you with the skills and abilities to interpret and critically evaluate what you perceive, the arguments you consider, and the information you receive.

Those sources of facts, findings and myths come from all kinds of places, such as personal experience and learned stories, articles in the news and trade journals, professional workshops, and consultants. Unfortunately, only some of this information will be accurate and useful to you. More often than not, this information will be misleading or even possibly harmful. This course will teach you how to weed out the useless, biased, or misleading information from that which is important and relevant to your goals and success as a manager. In this course, we will examine inherent biases in human decision making, common tricks and mistakes of logic, the nature of cause and effect relationships, and how to know which information to trust and which to avoid.</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>As a result of taking this course, you will be able to:</p><ul><li>be more aware of, and potentially able to overcome, common errors in our own and others\u2019 perceptions, logic, and biases in decision making.</li><li>understand the concept of cause and effect and distinguish it from junk science.</li><li>critically evaluate \u201cresearch findings\u201d and \u201cfacts\u201d that appear in the popular press or trade journals.</li><li>be able to determine the usefulness of arguments, opinions, and evidence for application to those in your organization.</li><li>be a more savvy consumer of news and media reports.</li></ul><p>Note: COHR 302 will not be offered in 2017W.</p><p>Prerequisite: COMM 291, COMM 292 and one of COMM 203, COMM 392.</p></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    1.5  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp;

It is intended as a course that will help you better interpret and understand what goes on around you in an organization. It will assist you to clarify how you might gain more control over your organizational life. It is also meant as an introduction to the ruts, pitfalls and traps in organizations as a means for you to think about ways to genuinely improve the productive contributions that can be made in organizations. It is a course that focuses on both the darker, shadowy and the positive sides of organizational life.<br/><br/> Strong emphasis in this course is on self discovery, on each of you learning to invent maps and images for yourself that can guide you toward organizational life. Organizations are continually evolving; we shape and give meaning to them through what we bring to organizational events and how we and others interpret what happens in these events.<br/><br/> A key assumption in this course is that it is not easy to understand the complexity and subtlety of organizations simply by reading and talking. What people ~ and what we encounter in our organizational worlds are often different from what we assume to be the case. Your understanding will come most effectively from experiencing organizational events, reflecting on them on your own and with others, and then synthesizing your insights with what you read in the literature about organizations and organizational behavior.</p><p>Note: COHR 311 will not be offered in 2017W.</p><p>Prerequisite: COMM 292 and one of COMM 203, COMM 392.</p></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    1.5  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COHR 401 - Organizational Change</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COHR 401 - Organizational Change</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>This course provides an introduction to the tactics and strategies for implementing constructive modifications in organizations.

It integrates experiential and intellectual learning components to help students become better negotiators. It is designed to develop the sophistication to analyze bargaining and conflict relationships and to learn (through class discussion and self-assessment) about your own individual \"bargaining styles\" as a leader. Negotiating skills are essential to achieve leadership goals. Leaders negotiate every day with a variety of stakeholders, including their employers, supervisors, direct reports, vendors, and suppliers. More than this, however, leaders negotiate intangibles, including expectations, ideas, and responsibilities. To be effective, leaders need to acquire analytical skills to effectively plan, strategize, and discover superior solutions to their own and their organizational challenges. They also need negotiation skills to get others to accept and implement these solutions. The goal of this course is to help you develop the negotiation skills needed to meet these leadership challenges.</p></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    1.5  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COMM 100 - Introduction to Business</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COMM 100 - Introduction to Business</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>This course informs potential managers and knowledge workers in all business areas about issues and problems related to the planning, establishment, and management of a successful business.

By developing good modeling skills, students will be able to solve and begin to develop managerial insight, in a variety of common and not so common problems that arise in today\u2019s business settings. The course also develops concepts of uncertainty, probability and simulation which are the foundation of many business problems.</p><p>The course opens with an introduction to modeling. Linear programming models are introduced and used to formulate a variety of problems of optimal allocation of resources, arising in such functional areas as Marketing, Production, Logistics and Financial Management. The computer package Microsoft Excel will be used to solve and analyze linear programming formulations in most of these examples.<br/><br/> In the second part of the course, we briefly introduce simulation, which is a methodology used to analyze complex decision problems. We also use simulation to introduce some fundamental tools needed for dealing with uncertainty: concepts of probability and random variables. These concepts are then used to analyze decision problems under uncertainty. The material on probability and random variables covered in COMM 290 will also be extensively used in the Business Statistics course, COMM 291.</p><p>Corequisite:\u00a0One of MATH 100, MATH 102, MATH 104, MATH 110, MATH 120, MATH 180, MATH 184.</p></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    3  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COMM 291 - Application of Statistics in Business</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COMM 291 - Application of Statistics in Business</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>The object of this course is to give you an understanding of how statistics operates in business and commerce.

The primary objective of this course is to teach you about the effects of organizational structures and interpersonal processes on the behaviour of individuals in organizations and the wider implications for the effectiveness and success of organizations. You will also learn to consider the entire organization as an actor and examine how it behaves in different types of environments. Throughout the course an emphasis is placed on how you, as an organizational member or consultant, might experience, interpret, and manage people, structures, and processes in organizations. The main goal of the course is to help you develop interpersonal skills that will allow you to succeed in your future career in business.</p><p>This course is designed to sharpen your ability to diagnose and solve a broad range of organizational problems. Through readings, lectures, cases, and experiential exercises, we will introduce you to frameworks from the social sciences that are useful for understanding organizational processes and teach you how to apply these frameworks<br/> to particular situations. The course has four topic areas:</p><ol><li>understanding individuals in the workplace.</li><li>communicating decisions.</li><li>designing and changing organizations.</li><li>leading others.</li></ol><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>During this course you will be exposed to a variety of topics and understandably, you will be expected to master a basic understanding of the concepts of organizational behaviour. Additionally, you will be engaged in an ongoing team process so that you can develop new interpersonal skills such as:</p><ol><li>awareness of how your values and attitudes affect the dynamics of your team.</li><li>awareness of how feedback, or the lack of it, affects the team process.</li><li>awareness of how motivating others, or failing to motivate others, directly affects team outcomes.</li><li>awareness of how you can more effectively contribute to team processes in the future.</li></ol><p>Moreover, you will work on a professional team consulting project and analyze a live organization to identify its problems and viable solutions. This will allow you to develop a deeper understanding of organizational processes and structures, and develop skills to manage organizations, their members, and their environments, including:</p><ol><li>awareness of how you can contribute to the proper functioning of organizations that you encounter as employee, customer, supplier, and stakeholder.</li><li>awareness of how you can contribute to the wider society.</li></ol></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    3  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COMM 293 - Financial Accounting</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COMM 293 - Financial Accounting</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Financial Accounting is principally concerned with the construction and interpretation of financial reports prepared for external parties to the issuing firm or entity.

The primary objective of this course is to teach you about the effects of organizational structures and interpersonal processes on the behaviour of individuals in organizations and the wider implications for the effectiveness and success of organizations. You will also learn to consider the entire organization as an actor and examine how it behaves in different types of environments. Throughout the course an emphasis is placed on how you, as an organizational member or consultant, might experience, interpret, and manage people, structures, and processes in organizations. The main goal of the course is to help you develop interpersonal skills that will allow you to succeed in your future career in business.</p><p>This course is designed to sharpen your ability to diagnose and solve a broad range of organizational problems. Through readings, lectures, cases, and experiential exercises, we will introduce you to frameworks from the social sciences that are useful for understanding organizational processes and teach you how to apply these frameworks<br/>to particular situations. The course has four topic areas:</p><ol><li>understanding individuals in the workplace.</li><li>communicating decisions.</li><li>designing and changing organizations.</li><li>leading others.</li></ol><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>During this course you will be exposed to a variety of topics and understandably, you will be expected to master a basic understanding of the concepts of organizational behaviour. Additionally, you will be engaged in an ongoing team process so that you can develop new interpersonal skills such as:</p><ol><li>awareness of how your values and attitudes affect the dynamics of your team.</li><li>awareness of how feedback, or the lack of it, affects the team process.</li><li>awareness of how motivating others, or failing to motivate others, directly affects team outcomes.</li><li>awareness of how you can more effectively contribute to team processes in the future.</li></ol><p>Moreover, you will work on a professional team consulting project and analyze a live organization to identify its problems and viable solutions. This will allow you to develop a deeper understanding of organizational processes and structures, and develop skills to manage organizations, their members, and their environments, including:</p><ol><li>awareness of how you can contribute to the proper functioning of organizations that you encounter as employee, customer, supplier, and stakeholder.</li><li>awareness of how you can contribute to the wider society.</li></ol><p>Note: This course is part of the\u00a0<a href=\"/courses-money-enrolment/minors-and-concentrations/minor-commerce\">Minor in Commerce program</a>\u00a0for students attending Faculties outside of the UBC Sauder School of Business.

Each student is expected to work toward developing his or her ability to evaluate and to choose among competing accounting methods. Students should strive to attain a level of understanding equal to that of a professional accountant.

It explores more deeply the reporting and analysis of costs in the management of the firm. Management accounting has two major roles:</p><ul><li>Decision-Facilitating role: Managers have the responsibility and authority for making decisions with respect to the use of the firm\u2019s resources. To do this effectively they must identify the alternative actions and strategies available to them, predict the possible consequences of those actions or strategies, and then choose the strategy course of action that has the most preferred predicted outcome. Management accounting systems can be effective tools both in providing information that is useful in predicting the possible consequences of alternative actions and in structuring the description of those consequences.</li><li>Decision-Influencing role: A manager is sometimes the sole owner of a firm, but more generally managers are employees or own the firm jointly with others. The choices made by a manager will depend on the predicted consequences that are of personal concern to her/him and her/his preferences with respect to those consequences. Consequently, the manager may not make the choices most preferred by the owners. To mitigate this problem, the firm\u2019s owners (or higher level managers) frequently establish formal or informal incentive systems that are designed to motivate the manager to choose the actions that they prefer.</li></ul><p>Both roles are considered in COMM 354 and 454, but the primary focus in COMM 354 is on the decision-facilitating role of management accounting. It is important to recognize that the management accounting system can report its information in any way that is useful to management. In particular, this system need not apply the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that must be applied in the preparation of externally reported financial statements. The objective is to help you develop the tools you need to find and analyze the relevant data necessary to make good business decisions. Learning will be structured around an interactive class environment.</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will have the knowledge and skills to:</p><ul><li>develop a business decision-making model which provides the foundation for analytical decision-making which incorporates uncertainty amidst qualitative and quantitative components and constraints.</li><li>assess a business situation, determine alternatives, select the most appropriate management accounting tool, implement the tool, build a comprehensive analysis and produce a thoughtful recommendation.</li><li>make well-reasoned recommendations for business decisions in settings where the information that is provided is relatively unstructured and where there is a dependence on data emanating from accounting systems.</li><li>position recommended decisions within the business context and strategy.</li><li>logically critique cost allocation mechanisms used in a various business contexts and provide recommendations for improving those mechanisms.</li><li>understand the informational needs of management and how they contrast with the financial information required by external entities, such as investors.</li><li>demonstrate competency in applying cost analysis tools, particularly linear programming and regression analysis and use the output from these tools to assist in decision-making.</li></ul><p>Prerequisite:\u00a0All of COMM 290, COMM 291, COMM 293, COMM 294.</p></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    3  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COMM 355 - Income Taxation</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COMM 355 - Income Taxation</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>The objective of the course is to introduce students to the Income Tax Act (Canada).

We will then examine how risk is priced in equilibrium, via the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and multi-factor models. While covering asset pricing models, we will also examine the models' implications for stock valuation, security selection, and performance evaluation. We will also ask whether the market values stocks efficiently, or whether there are \u201cabnormal\u201d returns leading to large profits.

This course provides students with practical opportunities to orient themselves to Aboriginal perspectives and to identify possibilities for economic partnerships through a fieldtrip to a reservation and meeting Aboriginal guest speakers.

The sector currently represents $9-12bn of investment capital. This\u00a0course provides an introduction to the impact investment sector, describes the evolution of impact\u00a0investment, the growth of new asset classes, and the opportunities and challenges faced by\u00a0investors seeking meaningful impact investment vehicles.\u00a0</p><p>According to the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), impact investing is defined as\u00a0\u201cinvestments made into companies, organizations and funds with the intention to generate\u00a0measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return\u201d. Impact investing, has\u00a0emerged over the past decade as one of the most talked about strategies for tackling social and\u00a0environmental problems. With the goal of creating measurable impact in addition to financial\u00a0returns, impact investing selects ventures working towards positive social or environmental\u00a0outcomes. The concepts of impact investing and social enterprise emerged out of a recognition\u00a0that the private sector could also contribute to the development of social agendas, while gaining a\u00a0financial return. Rather than focusing solely on a risk-return nexus, impact investing broadens to\u00a0the \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d to include financial, social, and environmental gains.\u00a0</p><p>Through a combination of readings, discussions, guest lectures, research, a pitch competition\u00a0and a portfolio allocation project, students will gain deep insight into the different perspectives\u00a0brought by the impact investor who is concerned with stimulating social and environmental impact\u00a0while generating financial return.\u00a0</p><p>Business students will complete the course having obtained a strong understanding of the\u00a0positive impacts financial tools can have economically, socially, and environmentally. Students\u00a0will also acquire practical knowledge of the tools and methodologies brought to impact investment\u00a0decisions and assessments.</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Describe the history of impact investing, how it has grown, and its current status.</li><li>Evaluate impact investing in the Canadian context and be able to compare Canada to the UK and US in terms of legal structure, public policy, and future potential.</li><li>Identify metrics used in evaluating social ventures, as well as where to find metrics resources and their relative strengths and weaknesses.</li><li>Describe why measuring impact is important and understanding the challenges faced by social ventures in attempting to measure their own impact.</li><li>Have a deep understanding of multiple sector-specific issues relevant to impact investing.</li><li>Apply tools to analyze social venture performance at both early stage and growth stage for possible funding.</li><li>Compare and contrast traditional portfolio management with new approaches such as Environmental, Social, and Governance criteria.</li><li>Analyse and compare different forms of impact investing (e.g., Venture Capital/Private Equity (VC/PE), Social Impact Bonds (SIBs), and Demand Dividends).</li><li>Create portfolio strategies specific to impact investing and be able to apply these strategies to real-life situations.</li><li>Apply the tools and tactics learned in the course to evaluate impact investing opportunities.</li></ul></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    3  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp;

In this course you learn about the distinctive elements of business writing by reading, critiquing, developing, and designing a variety of documents for various audiences. The course is built around four assignments, all of which require planning, researching, and writing a short, professional-quality document. Given the importance of teamwork in business settings, one of the assignments is a group project involving the development of a business proposal. In addition, students complete several in-class activities that focus on realistic business communication situations. Techniques for honing your style and editing skills are also covered. We will use a variety of learning methodologies including lectures, visual aids, case studies, class discussions, self-assessments, feedback, and experiential activities. The most important element, however, is your active engagement and participation.</p><p>While the passing grade in undergraduate courses is generally 50%, academic regulations for the BCom program stipulate that in order to qualify for the BCom degree, students must complete the Business Writing course with a minimum grade of 60%.</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>This course focuses on improving your skills in gathering, analyzing, and organizing information, and in communicating that information in effective and persuasive business documents. By the end of this course, students should be able to:</p><ul><li>communicate effectively to different audiences using appropriate tone and style.</li><li>collect, judge and synthesize information from a broad range of sources.</li><li>prepare a variety of business documents (including memos, letters, emails, and reports) using appropriate headings, layout, and format.</li><li>support your claims or arguments with logical and persuasive reasoning and evaluate the arguments of others.</li><li>collaborate productively with others to write and edit documents.</li></ul><p>Prerequisite: One of ENGL 112, ASTU 150, WRDS 150, ENGL 100, ENGL 120, ENGL 121, ENGL 1st.

It builds on skills covered in <a href=\"http://www.sauder.ubc.ca/Programs/Bachelor_of_Commerce/Current_Students/Registration/Course_Descriptions/COMM_390\">COMM 390 Business Writing</a>: researching ideas, organizing findings and presenting information in a logical, audience-focused manner. Development of effective communication skills is the link that connects both courses. The significant difference is that in COMM 395 students communicate their ideas primarily in the form of presentations rather than in written messages. As of September 2013, COMM 395 is a compulsory course for obtaining a BCom degree from Sauder, and it is offered to third and fourth year students only.</p><p>Students are provided with a series of oral communication challenges in the course. Of the five main assignments, four are individual presentations and one is a group assignment. The assignments are based on realistic business scenarios: presenting information, presenting a persuasive argument, making a statement of personal significance, making an impromptu speech, and presenting findings and observations about an actual company (group project). These five assignments are supplemented in the classroom by numerous activities intended to provide students with practice and feedback on their developing oral communication skills. As is the case with COMM 390, the assessment process for COMM 395 is designed to provide extensive feedback to each student on all main assignments. Both courses are distinguished by offering students the chance to learn by doing.</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><ul><li>Speak confidently in front of others on a broad range of topics.</li><li>Create audience-focused presentations that are interesting, informative, persuasive and engaging.</li><li>Research and organize information so that your talks have rich content that is logically organized, creating a natural flow of ideas.</li><li>Design visually attractive presentation slides that enhance your talk.</li><li>Create easy to understand visual representations (charts &amp; graphs) of quantitative data for use on presentation slides.</li><li>Describe the meaning of complex quantitative information in easy to understand plain English.</li><li>Learn personal strategies for dealing with stage fright.</li><li>Speak \u2018off the cuff\u2019 in impromptu situations.</li><li>Listen actively: good speakers are also good listeners, which allows them to pose relevant questions and offer insightful feedback.</li><li>Take an active role in group conversations by voicing your opinion and sharing your ideas.</li></ul><p>Note: This course was formerly numbered COMM 486U.</p><h3>Sauder Public Speaking Competition</h3><p>The Sauder Public Speaking Competition is an annual invitational event for which COMM 395 Business Communications instructors nominate their most capable students from the past 12 months.

Due to the broad nature of the subject it is important to educate professionals with a proper understanding of these issues. The primary objective of this course is to provide the students with an introduction to LOM. The main topics covered are: Operations Strategy, Processes in Manufacturing and Services, Quality Management, Forecasting, Scheduling, Inventory Management, Sales and Operations Planning, Business Logistics, selected issues in Supply Chain Management and Team work Emotional Intelligence.</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>Students will learn selected analytical tools used in each of these categories and apply them to problems through assignments, case work and in class exercises.

The second half of the course follows the stages in the development process, with more of a focus on the practical issues of selecting a site, designing a project, negotiating the maze of government regulation, and financing the acquisition of the land and construction of the structure. The focus of the course is a student prepared development project proposal. Guest lectures by real estate professionals will augment the academic material with real world applications. In addition to lectures the course will include several cases and student presentations.</p><p>Prerequisite:\u00a0One of COMM 297, COMM 298 and one of COMM 295, ECON 201, ECON 301.</p></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    3  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COMM 412 - Negotiation</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COMM 412 - Negotiation</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. It is designed to be relevant to the broad spectrum of negotiation problems that are faced by managers and professionals. The course will provide participants with an opportunity to develop negotiation skills experientially and to understand negotiation in useful analytic frameworks. Considerable emphasis will be placed on simulations, role-plays, and cases. Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. The central issues of this course deal with understanding the behaviour of individuals, groups, and organizations in the context of competitive situations.</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>The objectives of the course are:</p><ul><li>to think about the nature of negotiation. This objective is paramount because many of the important aspects of negotiation are ambiguous and often do not have \"right\" answers \u2013 we cannot teach a set of formulae that will always maximize your profit.</li><li>to gain a broad, intellectual understanding of the central concepts in negotiation. These concepts will be building blocks from which we can systematically understand and evaluate the negotiation process.</li><li>to gain an appreciation for systematic biases in the judgement of negotiators, and learn to guard against them in your own behaviour.</li><li>to improve analytical abilities in understanding the behaviour of individuals, groups, and organizations in competitive situations.</li><li>to provide experience in the negotiation process, including learning to evaluate the costs and benefits of alternative actions and how to manage the negotiation process.</li><li>to develop confidence in the negotiation process as an effective means for resolving conflict in negotiations.</li><li>to be able to formulate an appropriate, effective strategy for almost any kind of negotiation.</li></ul></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    3  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COMM 414 \u2013 Data Visualization and Business Analytics</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COMM 414 \u2013 Data Visualization and Business Analytics</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Business professionals must have familiarity with and skills in each of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics.

Inter-functional coordination is reviewed by examining how logistics is coordinated or integrated with marketing and corporate strategy. Next, a thorough grounding in concepts, alternatives and tools for the primary activities of logistics: inventory, transportation, warehousing and order processing are presented. This provides the basis for examining issues in logistics system design, including stock location, sourcing, number and location of facilities and flow management. The organizational design of the logistics system across the internal supply chain is examined if time permits. Various problems and case assignments seek to encourage problem conceptualization, the application of quantitative methods, and the utilization of computing capability for solving logistics problems in specific areas and for designing the logistics system.</p><p>Students will learn how an integration of economics and operations provide a powerful set of tools for analyzing and providing solutions in logistics management.\u00a0</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>explain business logistics concepts.</li><li>discuss how logistics activities produce value in the business organization.</li><li>apply analytical methods appropriate to logistics decision making.</li><li>address real world problems in logistics by applying the concepts and tools of business analysis.</li><li>improve logistics decision making effectiveness through experience in problem formulation and solution recommendation.</li><li>apply systems concepts to logistics problems.</li><li>integrate logistics strategy with marketing, production and corporate strategy.</li><li>achieve a proficiency in the application of one or more tools applicable to logistics problems.</li><li>demonstrate proficiency in one or more logistics processes.</li><li>describe the core decisions which apply to logistics services management.</li><li>describe key challenges that logistics services providers fact, both in the day-to-day and longer term time horizons.</li></ul><p>Note: COMM 448 will not be offered in 2017W.</p><p>Prerequisite: One of COMM 204, COMM 399.</p></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    3  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COMM 449 - Supply-Chain Management</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COMM 449 - Supply-Chain Management</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>This course covers the integrated management of production and logistics systems.

Practical competence in taxes requires years of special training. Constant changes in tax laws, regulations, and judicial interpretations add to this complexity. While tax issues pervade business and personal financial planning, most accounting and finance courses only deal with tax issues briefly, if at all. So how does a non-specialist in tax deal with this?<br/><br/> The objective of this course is to provide a financial economics framework for thinking about taxes, and how to take taxes into account in decision-making. We will discuss the general ways to benefit from tax planning. Although many different techniques are used in practice, there are just a few basic ideas that pervade most (perhaps all?) tax-planning strategies. Examples will be based on both personal tax planning and corporate tax planning. This course will not turn you into a tax professional. Nor will it provide you with detailed and comprehensive knowledge of current tax law. Notice that the Income Tax Act is not required nor even recommended course material.

Marketing pinciples have been applied to such areas as encouraging safe and healthy behaviors, protecting the environment, developing audiences for arts organizations, providing medical care and other health services, designing and delivering social services, improving education programs, and fund raising. The underlying theme of this course is that a marketing orientation can make nonprofit organizations and public agencies more effective and more responsive to consumer, client, and constituency needs.</p><p>While marketing was originally developed and conceived of as a business function, for the past thirty years it has been applied to help organizations achieve social change. In successfully applying marketing beyond the business sector, important differences between businesses and nonprofit organizations need to be recognized. For example, the objective function is no longer profits, but achieving a social goal. Much of the funding of the organizations comes not from users, but from government agencies or donors, who may have different priorities than do the clients. Social change programs often target deeply held beliefs and personal behaviors that are resistant to change. Volunteers as well as paid professionals play a critical role in managing the organization and delivering services. This course will identify significant opportunities and important barriers in the use of social and nonprofit marketing and provide approaches to using marketing in new settings.</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will have the knowledge and skills to:</p><ul><li>develop a framework for analyzing marketing problems outside the business sector and gain an understanding of the characteristics which differentiate business from nonbusiness marketing.</li><li>apply marketing in a diverse range of areas.</li></ul></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    3  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COMM 461 - Business Development</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COMM 461 - Business Development</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>This course prepares you to integrate your training in marketing with a critical layer of sales and business development theories and its managerial implications for an organization.

New Venture Design student teams have gained recognition and won prizes in each of the last several years. Teams have seen success in competitions including CBC\u2019s <em>Dragon\u2019s Den</em>, New Ventures BC, Lee Kuan Yew Global Business Plan Competition in Singapore, and Queens University to name a few. The main benefits of these competitions however is to gain experiences, find mentors, and build contacts.</p><p>During the course, teams of five or six students will propose one or more products, then evaluate the products based on their potential market, their estimated manufacturing and distribution costs, and other factors. The output from the course will be the development of a business plan for a proposed new enterprise, and the demonstration of a prototype of the product. Commerce students will primarily lead the business plan development, and students in engineering will primarily lead the prototype development. For example, the product can be a new physical device, a new software product, or a new engineering process. Lectures in the course will address creativity, market definition, financial projections, the design cycle, product marketing, manufacturing, distribution, support and repair.</p><p>Admission to COMM 466 (cross-listed with APSC 486) is by application only.

Because they offer low transaction costs and new profit patterns, Forward, Futures, Options and other derivative products have become essential tools for managing financial risks. Derivatives can also be added to bonds or otherwise combined to create new securities that can be used for risk management. The process of constructing new instruments from these building blocks is called financial engineering.</p><p>Derivatives are becoming increasingly used through the business world. Corporations and financial institutions, as well as pension funds, and some regional and local governments are using derivatives.

This course is about formulating corporate environmental strategy in a world characterized by unprecedented environmental challenges such as climate change, air and water pollution, water scarcity, health risks, as well as the challenges posed by resource depletion and the increasing need to change from carbon-based energy sources to renewable energy sources. To explore the role of an \"environmental manager\" in a firm and understand corporate environmental strategy, this course explores economic principles underlying environmental policy, environmental law, and the environmental technologies that facilitate pollution prevention and pollution abatement. Theoretical analysis is complemented by an exploration of practical tools that include environmental management systems (EMS), ISO 14001 certification, environmental marketing and eco-labeling, and life-cycle analysis. Small case studies augment the discussion by focusing on conceptual issues as well as individual BC-based ventures, particularly those in the renewable-energy sector.</p><p>Note:\u00a0Credit will be granted for only one of COMM 487, COMM 597.\u00a0</p></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    3  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, Money and Enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COMM 490F - Examining the Role of Finance in Society</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COMM 490F - Examining the Role of Finance in Society</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>This course is a <a href=\"http://students.ubc.ca/success/student-directed-seminars\" target=\"_blank\">Student Directed Seminar</a>\u00a0offered in 2016W only.

This simulation, currently used at several hundred colleges and universities, provides a reasonably realistic environment in which students gain experience with managing a $100 million hypothetical sensor manufacturing firm in a U.S. oligopoly. Student teams compete for sales among several products by setting goals and devising and implementing strategies and decisions to achieve these goals in the areas of production, marketing, finance, HR and labour relations. These decisions are simulated by one of the most realistic and complex business simulations available. A complex, interactive set of\u00a0mathematical formulae and rules have been programmed on a computer which, when provided with the decision inputs by the participating firms (student teams), determines the consequences of these decisions and generates a number of financial statements and operating reports for each firm. Student firms report to an Executive Committee of the Board of Directors that represents stockholders\u2019 interests. The Board raises challenging questions regarding the firm\u2019s planning policies and operations, evaluates the firm\u2019s performance, and provides experienced suggestions on how students may improve their future performance.</p><h3>Learning objectives</h3><p>By the end of this course, students will be expected to understand the components of the strategy-making process, including an emphasis on detailed analysis of interdependencies among the functional areas of a business. This course also provides hands-on experience in organizing and operating a group to accomplish a complex but well-defined task and thus provides an opportunity to develop interpersonal, leadership and communications skills that are so important in business. It is also expected that the student will be able to clearly articulate his/her role in a management structure and communicate clearly to a board of directors how he/she participated in the management of a firm.</p><p>Note: COMM 492 will not be offered in 2017W.</p><p>Prerequisite: All of COMM 390, COMM 395.</p></div></div></div> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-course-credits\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<span class=\"field-label\">\n    Course credits:\n  </span>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-course-credits field-type-text field-label-inline inline\">\n    3  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>""<section class=\"col-sm-12\"><div class=\"panel-pane pane-page-breadcrumb\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"><li class=\"breadcrumb-0\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-1\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment\">Courses, money &amp; enrolment</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-2\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses-and-registration\">Courses and registration</a></li><li class=\"breadcrumb-3\"><a href=\"/courses-money-and-enrolment/courses\">Course search</a></li><li class=\"active\">COMM 493 - Strategic Management in Business</li></ol> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><h1 class=\"page-title\">COMM 493 - Strategic Management in Business</h1>\n<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div><div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>This course is taught from the perspective of a senior manager.
