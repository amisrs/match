Central to this process is the creation, architecture/modelling and design of information within the website. Websites are a key part of many information systems and user-centred website iterative design is an example of an information management cycle (Choo, 2002). The module also teaches the practical skills necessary to effectively implement the website using the latest Web standards and industry standard technologies. The assessment is in three parts: 1) weekly online tests and tasks; 2) a whole day group design project; 3) a half day laboratory implementation test. Students must be available the week before the start of Semester 2 (2nd to 6th February 2015). This module is core for MA Multilingual Management and MA Digital Library Management is students. It is also an approved module for MSc Information Management and CPD pathway students.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Peter Holdridge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Information School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=INF&amp;dept_name=Information+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#INF6012\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

This change occurs in complex social environments and has cultural, political, structural and ethical impacts that need to be carefully managed. The module will examine and explore how both managers and Information Systems practitioners can be better prepared for the unpredictability, unintended outcomes and possible harmful consequences of change caused by the introduction or update of Information Systems. Therefore, the module aims at providing an understanding of both approaches and techniques for the managing of this change and pays particular attention to the role of the Information Systems project managers and practitioners in the change management process.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Dr Pamela Abbott</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Seminars, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work, Group Presentation</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Information School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=INF&amp;dept_name=Information+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#INF6021\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

Such insights can provide huge economic value and competitive advantages. Data Mining is the process by which this is done. This module will examine fundamental algorithms for clustering and classifying data as well as data visualisation strategies and data mining applications. Students will be introduced to key themes in data mining, including types of data mining problem (e.g. classification, clustering, rule mining), common algorithms used in machine learning (e.g. SVM, decision trees, k-means), feature selection and evaluation issues (e.g. measures and standardised benchmarks). It will also explore Data Visualisation (and visual analytics), the graphical representation of information that provides a qualitative understanding of the information on which decisions can be based. The last part of the module will present different applications of data mining to improve businesses (e.g., opinion mining) and user experience (e.g., recommender systems). Case studies will be used throughout the module to highlight the use of data mining methods and visualisation for tackling real-world problems. Students will gain practical hands-on experience through the use of widely used software tools (e.g. WEKA for data mining and Tableau Public for visualisation).\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Dr Gianluca Demartini</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Problem solving, Laboratory work, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebCT resources are available for this module</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Information School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=INF&amp;dept_name=Information+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#INF6028\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

A database is an organised collection of data, typically describing the activities of one or more organisations and a core component of modern information systems. A Database Management System (DBMS) is software designed to assist in maintaining and utilising large collections of data and becoming a necessity for all organisations. This module provides an introduction to the area of databases and database management, relational database design and a flavour of some advanced topics in current database research that deal with different kinds of data often found within an organisational context. Lectures are structured into three main areas:\n\n\u00bf\tAn introduction to databases\n\u00bf\tThe process of designing relational databases\n\u00bf\tAdvanced topics (e.g. data warehouses and non-relational databases)\n\nThe course includes a series of online tasks with supporting `drop in\u00bf laboratories aimed at providing you with the skills required to implement a database in Oracle and extract information using the Structured Query Language (SQL).\n\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Dr Peter Stordy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Seminars, Laboratory work, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work, Lab work, Weekly tasks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebCT resources are available for this module</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Information School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=INF&amp;dept_name=Information+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#INF6050\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

For example, we use IR systems when we search the Web, look for resources using a library catalogue or search for relevant information within  organisational repositories (e.g. intranets). This module provides an introduction to the area of information retrieval and computerised techniques for organsing, storing and searching (mainly) textual information items. Techniques used in IR systems are related to, but distinct from, those used in databases. The emphasis for IR systems is to find documents that contain relevant information and separate these from a potentially vast set of non-relevant documents. The content of the module is grouped into two main areas: (1) fundamental concepts of IR (indexing, retrieval, ranking, user interaction and evaluation) and (2) applying IR in specific domains (Web, libraries and enterprises) and dealing with non-textual and non-English content (multimedia and multilingual IR).\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Restrictions on availability: </strong>\nPriority to students in the Department of Information Studies\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Prof Paul Clough</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Information School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=INF&amp;dept_name=Information+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#INF6060\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

A database is an organised collection of data, typically describing the activities of one or more organisations and a core component of modern information systems. A Database Management System (DBMS) is software designed to assist in maintaining and utilising large collections of data and becoming a necessity for all organisations. This module provides an introduction to the area of databases and database management, relational database design and a flavour of some advanced topics in current database research that deal with different kinds of data often found within an organisational context. Lectures are structured into three main areas: (1) an introduction to databases, (2) the process of designing relational databases, and (3) advanced topics (e.g. data warehouses and non-relational databases). The course includes a series of practical sessions aimed at providing you with the skills required to implement a database in Oracle and extract information using the Structured Query Language (SQL).\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Dr Peter Stordy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials, Laboratory work, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work, Lab work, 12 x 1 hour weekly tasks via MOLE submission.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebCT resources are available for this module</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Information School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=INF&amp;dept_name=Information+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#INF6505\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

It also provides a brief historical overview of the subject and reviews the state-of-the-art and open questions in some of the major subareas of AI, pointing out connections to research work in the Department. As well as providing a first encounter with the main issues that underlie attempts to create Artificial Intelligence, the module also has a more practical component that introduces algorithms and data structures for AI problem solving through practical programming examples, as well as hands-on experience with simple programming of humaoid robots.  The emphasis here is on identifying the abstract nature of the problem which is to be solved, matching this to an appropriate algorithm or technique and implementing a solution. It also serves as an introduction to programming for research rather than for software engineering.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>R Gaizauskas &amp; P Green</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Formal Exam, Course work, MOLE Quizzes</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Notes: </strong>\nThis unit forms part of an accredited degree programme\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Computer Science):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/dcs\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=COM&amp;dept_name=Computer+Science&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#COM1005\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

Projects are suggested and supervised by Department of Computer Science staff. Students form groups and choose a project which interests them, then refine the scope of the research by conducting a thorough analysis of the topic area and formulating a solution also with the help of their supervisor. The project is developed under strong supervision and appropriate interim reports are produced and presented. \n\nThe project culminates with the production of a publication of the research finding and a full report of the work carried out, as well a final conference style presentation.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Prof J Derrick</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Laboratory work, Independent Study, With project supervisor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work, Presentations</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Notes: </strong>\nThis unit forms part of an accredited degree programme\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Computer Science):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/dcs\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=COM&amp;dept_name=Computer+Science&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#COM4520\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

This notion of scarcity is as relevant in the health care sector as it is elsewhere and, thus, it is important that the resources available to health and health care are used in the best possible ways. This course will: look at how \"best\" should be defined in the context of health care; consider the roles that market forces and governments might play in achieving the sector's objectives; and discuss what information is needed so that resources can be deployed where they will do the most good. The aims of the module are: 1.\tTo enable students to develop a critical understanding of the basis of health economics.\n2.

The market for health care fails to satisfy most of the key conditions of a perfect maket, leading to an efficiency-based justification for government intervention. At the same time, health can be regarded as a special commodity, because it is fundamental to individual well-being and flourishing, which may give an equity-based justification for government intervention. The aim of the module is to examine these justifications, and to see the role played by two different  nomative approaches (welfarist and non-welfarist) to the problem.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Dr Aki Tsuchiya</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Formal Exam, Course work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebCT resources are available for this module</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Economics):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/economics/\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=ECN&amp;dept_name=Economics&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#ECN6580\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

It will be made plain that the accumulation of information is but a small part of education, and of little value without the ability to assess and use this information. The module will impress on students the importance of questioning and the dangers of simply accepting what they are told.\nTo this end, the module is intended to be provocative. Nothing is presented as right or wrong, but rather as a point of view. The module is also intended to be entertaining, on the grounds that enjoyment is an aid to learning. It is also quite demanding in that there is preparatory work for each lecture, and there are tasks are to be carried out after each lecture.\nThe module leader will present lectures in semester 1. A wide range of management issues will be covered. The aim is to be contentious, to examine what may be familiar issues in ways that are probably unfamiliar. The objective is to enable students to look at issues \u00bf and not just those covered in this module \u00bf critically.\nIn semester 2, each weekly lecture will be presented by a different academic, charged with: \n\u00bf\texplaining from his own activities just what academics do and why they do it\n\u00bf\tdemonstrating that things are things worth knowing for reasons other than earning marks, that curiosity matters, that finding out can be fun\n\u00bf\tthat universities can do more than grant degrees and that employers want much more than qualifications. \n\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Restrictions on availability: </strong>\nOnly available to students for whom it is core\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Stuart Macdonald</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT134\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

Through a series of 4 four-week `packages' the module will introduce students to key issues within marketing, sustainable development, operations management and strategic management. The module is designed to help students to start to identify the interconnections between the different disciplines within management and to see how differing perspectives tackle key contemporary challenges. The module will be delivered through a series of 4-week subject `packages' by experts in the different disciplines. While the lectures will provide the foundation for student learning, this will be supplemented by guest speakers from within industry to apply concepts to actual business settings.  Seminars will provide space for more detailed discussion of issues and topics covered during the module. Key skills sessions will also be interspersed between the different subject packages so that students will be able to develop these generic skills which they can utilise in the various assessments components and for which they will receive feedback.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Elizabeth Carnegie</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Seminars, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work, Integrative task including a podcast</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT136\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

This is reflected in the global uptake of enterprise resource planning (ERP).  Organisations of all sizes are becoming increasingly dependent on their information systems (IS) for business success. However, organisation structures and systems are changing rapidly and this places an extra burden on managers to accurately identify their information requirements. This puts pressure on staff involved in the development of IS to ensure that managers receive the right information at the right time for effective decision-making. This has led to a rapid increase in the utilisation of business intelligence software.  \nIt is probably the utilisation of ERP2 that will provide organisations with a sustainable competitive edge.  This will require companies to glean intelligence regarding crucial areas of the business, i.e. customers, competitors, human capital and suppliers.  This business intelligence is often in short supply even in the largest organisations.  These rapidly changing business environments also make it difficult to design IS that will remain valid for several years.  MGT218 incorporates live case studies to accentuate key learning within the module. Similarly, the nature of the assignment makes MGT218 a very practical module.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Formal Exam, Course work, Group Presentation</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT218\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

The module proceeds to explore separately the main mechanisms of governance and specifically investigates whether governance characteristics influence corporate performance.  In particular, the module examines the governance role of non-executive directors; ownership structure; executive remuneration and takeovers.

This is done by examining the various historical, economic, political and social assumptions about the nature of enterprise and entrepreneurship.  In addition, because there is always an important human story behind enterprise activity and the creation of a small business, the module will examine many individual and organisational stories (from emerging, growing and mature businesses) in order to assess the factors and challenges involved in starting and running your own business.  In this module students will also have the opportunity to evaluate their personal orientations to entrepreneurship and sharpen their appreciation of what it is like being self employed, working in the family business, being an owner-manager, being a corporate entrepreneur or running a franchise business.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Restrictions on availability: </strong>\nBA Business Management, BA IBM (3rd years), and dual students with BA Business Management as one half of their degree\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials, Independent Study, </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work, Elevator pitch presentation</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT229\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

Audit failure, the collapse of the western banking system, market volatility, inequality, and the unprecedented challenges to business presented by climate change compel the profession and its standard-setting authorities to address a moral accountability in the face of changing societal expectations. This course challenges the traditional precepts upon which accounting processes, external reporting and its regulation are based. It gets you to question your own accounting education and think more deeply about generally-accepted practice in a democratic, capitalist economy.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Formal Exam, Course work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebCT resources are available for this module</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Notes: </strong>\nRequired for BAEC accreditation.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT302\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

An audit is the independent examination of, and expression of an opinion on, the financial statements of an enterprise.  Audit has crucial roles to play in the processes of corporate and social governance, relating especially to the transmission of information to financial markets and individual/groups to whom organisations are accountable.  In the `audit society\u00bf, the meaning of audit has broadened to embrace diverse forms of inspection and non-financial performance reporting. This course is designed to introduce students to the major issues in auditing theory and practice, making reference to current contexts.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Formal Exam, Course work</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT304\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

From such viewpoints, the case study has emerged as a valuable research and teaching method, a way of enabling researchers and students alike to better understand the practical role of accounting &amp; finance in organisations &amp; society. Rather than relying on abstract text books or normative theories, the case study permits the development of more `grounded\u00bf knowledge.\nMGT 329 is a course based upon the analysis of case studies. It aims to allow students to handle complex information sets, undertake their own research, apply accounting and finance knowledge gain elsewhere on the degrees programme, make judgements as to the relevance of various data sources and empirical findings. Through the analysis of case studies, this module aims to offer a rich context for the use of different approaches, varied and contradictory data sources, and original &amp; creative approaches to problem solving. \n\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT329\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

Again we are asking `what is the role of the firm?\u00bf \nMuch of the dialogue and debate surrounding this issue is being conducted under the rubric of the concepts of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Citizenship. The emergence of these concepts and the implementation of strategies to emphasise and improve the socially responsible practices of companies represents a significant development in the ongoing debates surrounding the role of business in modern society. Supporters suggest we are witnessing the emergence of a new breed of `Corporate Citizen\u00bf as companies seek greater interaction with civil society, look to adopt more ethical business strategies and engagement about their practices through the provision of greater openness and access to information.\nThis module seeks to provide an initial introduction to the key issues and themes that are emerging within the CSR field. It examines the pressures encouraging companies to adopt more ethical business strategies, the types of practices and strategies which different companies have sought to adopt in this field, and the potential advantages that are identified for a socially responsible business. \n\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Restrictions on availability: </strong>\nManagement School students only\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Formal Exam, Peer assessment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebCT resources are available for this module</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT357\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

The successful commercialisation of both new and already existing products and services depends on how well the company will communicate any messages to its target market, to trigger desired attitudes and behaviours. However, these messages must be clear and consistent across the different means of communication available to modern businesses. Thus, advertising, public relations, sponsorship, direct marketing, product placement and any other promotional tool must be integrated and managed as a whole and not as isolated communications. Other issues covered will include e-IMC, international marketing communications, and ethics. \nThe material builds upon the basic marketing principles discussed in MGT117 and on aspects of consumer behaviour from MGT220.\n\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Formal Exam, Course work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebCT resources are available for this module</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Notes: </strong>\nMGT358 will contribute to exemptions for students from the Chartered Institute of Marketing's qualifications in combination with other marketing units offered within the School\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT358\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

The unit explores meaning-making as a negotiated arena in which we, as human beings, draw on deep-rooted assumptions and expectations. Second, the unit aims to enable students to communicate more effectively in organisational contexts, in their future roles as managers, consultants or researchers. More broadly, the aim is to develop students' ability to learn and manage their own learning, and to encourage effective time management and personal resources planning. Having completed this unit students should be able to discuss current theoretical approaches to language use and meaning-making in organisations, apply this theory to their own experiences of organisation, critically evaluate the role of language in effective leadership, and in the management of change, and use the techniques and approaches introduced in this unit to communicate more effectively in their future work settings.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Restrictions on availability: </strong>\nLevel 3 Management School students only\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work, Presentation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebCT resources are available for this module</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT364\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

The task of delivering business growth in fast moving environments requires that companies explore new opportunities whilst exploiting exisiting product markets. This simultaneous activity demands new strategic and organisational approaches by managers. Companies need the ability to use several different strategy development methods as well as to disperse the strategic thinking function through the company in order to remain competitive and adaptable. Building upon knowledge gained in the first semester of the MBA and participants' work experience, the module  explores the issues that these new strategic and organisational demands raise and the theoretical and practical concepts proposed to help managers address them.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Restrictions on availability: </strong>\nOnly available to MBA students\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Karen Hector</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebCT resources are available for this module</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT6041\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems of manufacturing organizations and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in the context of a manufacturing organization.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Restrictions on availability: </strong>\nOnly available for students on the Executive MBA\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT6185\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

Learning is brought alive by continual use of real world data from quoted companies, and it is the student's ability to interpret concepts and techniques in the markets that is tested.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Restrictions on availability: </strong>\nEMBA only\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Chris Cox</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Seminars, Tutorials, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work, Individual or dual presentation to the tutor acting as an investor</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT6199\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

However, the introduction of EIS can be complex and it leads to substantial organisational change when they are implemented.  This is as well as the  high costs charged by suppliers.

These managerial skills can be organised into three areas.  The first area relates to the cognitive aspects of managerial work and the personal management or learning skills involved (i.e. time management, motivation, initiative, self awareness, openness to others, ability to reflect, make decisions, solve problems etc).  The second area relates more closely to the function of management that is realised through a set of inter personal skills (involving team working, sensitivity to others, negotiation, persuasion, influencing and communication).  The third area relates to the research and inquiry skills that are central to the shaping of effective managerial work.  Having good research skills enables managers to be more effective in their decision-making and evaluation of different strategic options.  Also, good management inquiry engenders intellectual curiosity and an ongoing inquiry with how things in the business world (such as organisations, markets, products, industry sectors, management).  Through this, cognitive, reflective and influencing skills are enhanced and alternative perspectives or solutions can be recognised.\n\nThis module demonstrates the importance of research and inquiry skills for enhancing effective managerial practice. Participants can extend and improve their practice in: accessing and synthesising a range of information channels and sources of evidence; interpreting complex data (numerical and discursive); evaluating different arguments; identifying gaps and weaknesses in these arguments; and selecting from a range of tools and techniques that will solve managerial, industry, market or business problems.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Restrictions on availability: </strong>\nMGTT33 Students only\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>David Shearn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Seminars, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work, Group presentation</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT6207\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

Therefore, people are the only resource that can provide sustained competitive advantage. Furthermore, the increasingly competitive environment makes the effective utilisation of our human resources even more valuable. Participants will be introduced into the most advanced methods available for recruiting and selecting human resources, developing them, and managing their performance, careers and commitment. The integration of the systems that are utilised for the management of human resources will be stressed as a critical factor for success. And the importance of seeking long-term commitment based solutions will be also illustrated. Finally, the inter-link between the management of human resources and the management of the non-human resources of the organisation will be made clear. Therefore, students will be able to conceive, design and implement lasting systems for the management of their workforce that will enable their organisations to meet their strategic targets.

This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Tutorials, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Formal Exam, Course work</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT6226\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

Where once technology was the key driver of organisational processes and innovation, today we have entered into the second machine-age where technology is simply a basic requirement for operations, deployed like a good personal assistant. The challenge today is in effectively managing the giant pools and streams of data, information, and intellectual assets that are essential for operational effectiveness and the key drivers of innovation. From enabling a digital workplace, to managing, using and securing its intellectual assets, the intelligent organisation is also cognisant of evolving digital transformations and scans cautiously and tactically for disruptive technologies (e.g., social, mobile, analytics, cloud) while adopting an effective digital strategy.

The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding and the design of associated processes.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n<strong>Restrictions on availability: </strong>\nTo MBA students\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon Rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Problem solving, Fieldwork, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work, Group Client Presentation on the methods applied and the solution proposed to the client.

Responding effectively to different kinds of challenges facing their enterprise, requires that entrepreneurs understand something of implementing change. The module will draw on theories of business change and emphasise their practical application to create resilient enterprises. The module will emphasise the connections between theory and practice such that students can develop `change skills' that are important in entrepreneurial contexts. Key to  implementing change effectively is developing self-awareness such that `automatic' responses can be identified and evaluated against research-informed alternatives before action is taken. Assessment is by written coursework based on a case study.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Staff Contact: </strong></td>\n<td>Sharon rose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Lectures, Seminars, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Course work</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT6257\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.

Finance directors make two major types of decisions, investment decisions and decisions on how to finance investment projects. Concerning investment decisions, the module reviews the determination of the cost of capital under uncertainty based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In terms of financing decisions, the link between shareholder value on one side and financing choices (debt versus equity financing) and dividend policy on the other side is examined. The module also discusses the motives behind mergers and acquisitions as well as the potential and actual gains from such operations for both the bidder and target firms. Finally, the traditional approach to finance which assumes that securities are in general fairly priced is contrasted with a more recent approach which argues that psychological effects systematically bias investor behaviour and therefore cause persistent mispricings.\n<p align=\"LEFT\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong></td>\n<td>Seminars, Laboratory work, Independent Study</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Assessment: </strong></td>\n<td>Formal Exam</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebCT resources are available for this module</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<strong>Information on the department responsible for this unit (Management School):</strong>\n<br/>\n<center>\n<table border=\"\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/management\">Departmental Home Page</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"web_tt.timetable?dept_code=MGT&amp;dept_name=Management+School&amp;p_unres=&amp;disp_year=17#MGT6340\"><strong>Teaching timetable</strong></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<form action=\"none\" method=\"GET\">\n<center><input onclick='location=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid\"' type=\"button\" value=\"SSID\"/><strong> | </strong><input onclick=\"history.go(-1)\" type=\"button\" value=\"Back\"/></center>\n</form>\n<hr/>\n<center><strong>NOTE</strong></center>\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the presented information, but the University can accept no responsibility for any errors or omissions. \n University courses are continually reviewed and revised.
